      "When Lionel Giles began his translation of Sun Tzŭ’s _Art of War_, the\nwork was virtually unknown in Europe. Its introduction to Europe began\nin 1782 when a French Jesuit Father living in China, Joseph Amiot,\nacquired a copy of it, and translated it into French. It was not a good\ntranslation because, according to Dr. Giles, \"[I]t contains a great\ndeal that Sun Tzŭ did not write, and very little indeed of what he\ndid.\"",
      "The first translation into English was published in 1905 in Tokyo by\nCapt. E. F. Calthrop, R.F.A. However, this translation is, in the words\nof Dr. Giles, \"excessively bad.\" He goes further in this criticism: \"It\nis not merely a question of downright blunders, from which none can\nhope to be wholly exempt. Omissions were frequent; hard passages were\nwillfully distorted or slurred over. Such offenses are less pardonable.\nThey would not be tolerated in any edition of a Latin or Greek classic,\nand a similar standard of honesty ought to be insisted upon in\ntranslations from Chinese.\" In 1908 a new edition of Capt. Calthrop’s\ntranslation was published in London. It was an improvement on the\nfirst—omissions filled up and numerous mistakes corrected—but new\nerrors were created in the process. Dr. Giles, in justifying his\ntranslation, wrote: \"It was not undertaken out of any inflated estimate\nof my own powers; but I could not help feeling that Sun Tzŭ deserved a\nbetter fate than had befallen him, and I knew that, at any rate, I\ncould hardly fail to improve on the work of my predecessors.\"",
      "Clearly, Dr. Giles’ work established much of the groundwork for the\nwork of later translators who published their own editions. Of the\nlater editions of the _Art of War_ I have examined; two feature Giles’\nedited translation and notes, the other two present the same basic\ninformation from the ancient Chinese commentators found in the Giles\nedition. Of these four, Giles’ 1910 edition is the most scholarly and\npresents the reader an incredible amount of information concerning Sun\nTzŭ’s text, much more than any other translation.",
      "The Giles’ edition of the _Art of War_, as stated above, was a\nscholarly work. Dr. Giles was a leading sinologue at the time and an\nassistant in the Department of Oriental Printed Books and Manuscripts\nin the British Museum. Apparently he wanted to produce a definitive\nedition, superior to anything else that existed and perhaps something\nthat would become a standard translation. It was the best translation\navailable for 50 years. But apparently there was not much interest in\nSun Tzŭ in English-speaking countries since it took the start of the\nSecond World War to renew interest in his work. Several people\npublished unsatisfactory English translations of Sun Tzŭ. In 1944, Dr.\nGiles’ translation was edited and published in the United States in a\nseries of military science books. But it wasn’t until 1963 that a good\nEnglish translation (by Samuel B. Griffith and still in print) was\npublished that was an equal to Giles’ translation. While this\ntranslation is more lucid than Dr. Giles’ translation, it lacks his\ncopious notes that make his so interesting.",
      "Dr. Giles produced a work primarily intended for scholars of the\nChinese civilization and language. It contains the Chinese text of Sun\nTzŭ, the English translation, and voluminous notes along with numerous\nfootnotes. Unfortunately, some of his notes and footnotes contain\nChinese characters; some are completely Chinese. Thus, a conversion to\na Latin alphabet etext was difficult. I did the conversion in complete\nignorance of Chinese (except for what I learned while doing the\nconversion). Thus, I faced the difficult task of paraphrasing it while\nretaining as much of the important text as I could. Every paraphrase\nrepresents a loss; thus I did what I could to retain as much of the\ntext as possible. Because the 1910 text contains a Chinese concordance,\nI was able to transliterate proper names, books, and the like at the\nrisk of making the text more obscure. However, the text, on the whole,\nis quite satisfactory for the casual reader, a transformation made\npossible by conversion to an etext. However, I come away from this task\nwith the feeling of loss because I know that someone with a background\nin Chinese can do a better job than I did; any such attempt would be\nwelcomed.\n\nBob Sutton\n\nPreface by Lionel Giles",
      "The seventh volume of _Mémoires concernant l’histoire, les sciences,\nles arts, les mœurs, les usages, &c., des Chinois_ is devoted to the\nArt of War, and contains, amongst other treatises, “Les Treize Articles\nde Sun-tse,” translated from the Chinese by a Jesuit Father, Joseph\nAmiot. Père Amiot appears to have enjoyed no small reputation as a\nsinologue in his day, and the field of his labours was certainly\nextensive. But his so-called translation of the Sun Tzŭ, if placed side\nby side with the original, is seen at once to be little better than an\nimposture. It contains a great deal that Sun Tzŭ did not write, and\nvery little indeed of what he did. Here is a fair specimen, taken from\nthe opening sentences of chapter 5:—",
      "_De l’habileté dans le gouvernement des Troupes._ Sun-tse dit : Ayez\nles noms de tous les Officiers tant généraux que subalternes;\ninscrivez-les dans un catalogue à part, avec la note des talents & de\nla capacité de chacun d’eux, afin de pouvoir les employer avec avantage\nlorsque l’occasion en sera venue. Faites en sorte que tous ceux que\nvous devez commander soient persuadés que votre principale attention\nest de les préserver de tout dommage. Les troupes que vous ferez\navancer contre l’ennemi doivent être comme des pierres que vous\nlanceriez contre des œufs. De vous à l’ennemi il ne doit y avoir\nd’autre différence que celle du fort au faible, du vide au plein.\nAttaquez à découvert, mais soyez vainqueur en secret. Voilà en peu de\nmots en quoi consiste l’habileté & toute la perfection même du\ngouvernement des troupes.",
      "Throughout the nineteenth century, which saw a wonderful development in\nthe study of Chinese literature, no translator ventured to tackle Sun\nTzŭ, although his work was known to be highly valued in China as by far\nthe oldest and best compendium of military science. It was not until\nthe year 1905 that the first English translation, by Capt. E.F.\nCalthrop. R.F.A., appeared at Tokyo under the title “Sonshi”(the\nJapanese form of Sun Tzŭ). Unfortunately, it was evident that the\ntranslator’s knowledge of Chinese was far too scanty to fit him to\ngrapple with the manifold difficulties of Sun Tzŭ. He himself plainly\nacknowledges that without the aid of two Japanese gentlemen “the\naccompanying translation would have been impossible.” We can only\nwonder, then, that with their help it should have been so excessively\nbad. It is not merely a question of downright blunders, from which none\ncan hope to be wholly exempt. Omissions were frequent; hard passages\nwere wilfully distorted or slurred over. Such offences are less\npardonable. They would not be tolerated in any edition of a Greek or\nLatin classic, and a similar standard of honesty ought to be insisted\nupon in translations from Chinese.",
      "From blemishes of this nature, at least, I believe that the present\ntranslation is free. It was not undertaken out of any inflated estimate\nof my own powers; but I could not help feeling that Sun Tzŭ deserved a\nbetter fate than had befallen him, and I knew that, at any rate, I\ncould hardly fail to improve on the work of my predecessors. Towards\nthe end of 1908, a new and revised edition of Capt. Calthrop’s\ntranslation was published in London, this time, however, without any\nallusion to his Japanese collaborators. My first three chapters were\nthen already in the printer’s hands, so that the criticisms of Capt.\nCalthrop therein contained must be understood as referring to his\nearlier edition. This is on the whole an improvement on the other,\nthought there still remains much that cannot pass muster. Some of the\ngrosser blunders have been rectified and lacunae filled up, but on the\nother hand a certain number of new mistakes appear. The very first\nsentence of the introduction is startlingly inaccurate; and later on,\nwhile mention is made of “an army of Japanese commentators” on Sun Tzŭ\n(who are these, by the way?), not a word is vouchsafed about the\nChinese commentators, who nevertheless, I venture to assert, form a\nmuch more numerous and infinitely more important “army.”",
      "A few special features of the present volume may now be noticed. In the\nfirst place, the text has been cut up into numbered paragraphs, both in\norder to facilitate cross-reference and for the convenience of students\ngenerally. The division follows broadly that of Sun Hsing-yen’s\nedition; but I have sometimes found it desirable to join two or more of\nhis paragraphs into one. In quoting from other works, Chinese writers\nseldom give more than the bare title by way of reference, and the task\nof research is apt to be seriously hampered in consequence. With a view\nto obviating this difficulty so far as Sun Tzŭ is concerned, I have\nalso appended a complete concordance of Chinese characters, following\nin this the admirable example of Legge, though an alphabetical\narrangement has been preferred to the distribution under radicals which\nhe adopted. Another feature borrowed from “The Chinese Classics” is the\nprinting of text, translation and notes on the same page; the notes,\nhowever, are inserted, according to the Chinese method, immediately\nafter the passages to which they refer. From the mass of native\ncommentary my aim has been to extract the cream only, adding the\nChinese text here and there when it seemed to present points of\nliterary interest. Though constituting in itself an important branch of\nChinese literature, very little commentary of this kind has hitherto\nbeen made directly accessible by translation.",
      "I may say in conclusion that, owing to the printing off of my sheets as\nthey were completed, the work has not had the benefit of a final\nrevision. On a review of the whole, without modifying the substance of\nmy criticisms, I might have been inclined in a few instances to temper\ntheir asperity. Having chosen to wield a bludgeon, however, I shall not\ncry out if in return I am visited with more than a rap over the\nknuckles. Indeed, I have been at some pains to put a sword into the\nhands of future opponents by scrupulously giving either text or\nreference for every passage translated. A scathing review, even from\nthe pen of the Shanghai critic who despises “mere translations,” would\nnot, I must confess, be altogether unwelcome. For, after all, the worst\nfate I shall have to dread is that which befell the ingenious paradoxes\nof George in _The Vicar of Wakefield_.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSun Wu and his Book\n\nSsu-ma Ch’ien gives the following biography of Sun Tzŭ: [1]\n\nSun Tzŭ Wu was a native of the Ch’i State. His _Art of War_ brought him\nto the notice of Ho Lu, [2] King of Wu. Ho Lu said to him:\n\n\"I have carefully perused your 13 chapters. May I submit your theory of\nmanaging soldiers to a slight test?\"\n\nSun Tzŭ replied: \"You may.\"\n\nHo Lu asked: \"May the test be applied to women?\"",
      "The answer was again in the affirmative, so arrangements were made to\nbring 180 ladies out of the Palace. Sun Tzŭ divided them into two\ncompanies, and placed one of the King’s favourite concubines at the head\nof each. He then bade them all take spears in their hands, and\naddressed them thus: \"I presume you know the difference between front\nand back, right hand and left hand?\"\n\nThe girls replied: Yes.\n\nSun Tzŭ went on: \"When I say \"Eyes front,\" you must look straight\nahead. When I say \"Left turn,\" you must face towards your left hand.\nWhen I say \"Right turn,\" you must face towards your right hand. When I\nsay \"About turn,\" you must face right round towards your back.\"\n\nAgain the girls assented. The words of command having been thus\nexplained, he set up the halberds and battle-axes in order to begin the\ndrill. Then, to the sound of drums, he gave the order \"Right turn.\" But\nthe girls only burst out laughing. Sun Tzŭ said: \"If words of command\nare not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly understood,\nthen the general is to blame.\"",
      "So he started drilling them again, and this time gave the order \"Left\nturn,\" whereupon the girls once more burst into fits of laughter. Sun\nTzŭ: \"If words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not\nthoroughly understood, the general is to blame. But if his orders _are_\nclear, and the soldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault of\ntheir officers.\"\n\nSo saying, he ordered the leaders of the two companies to be beheaded.\nNow the king of Wu was watching the scene from the top of a raised\npavilion; and when he saw that his favourite concubines were about to be\nexecuted, he was greatly alarmed and hurriedly sent down the following\nmessage: \"We are now quite satisfied as to our general’s ability to\nhandle troops. If we are bereft of these two concubines, our meat and\ndrink will lose their savor. It is our wish that they shall not be\nbeheaded.\"\n\nSun Tzŭ replied: \"Having once received His Majesty’s commission to be\nthe general of his forces, there are certain commands of His Majesty\nwhich, acting in that capacity, I am unable to accept.\"",
      "Accordingly, he had the two leaders beheaded, and straightway installed\nthe pair next in order as leaders in their place. When this had been\ndone, the drum was sounded for the drill once more; and the girls went\nthrough all the evolutions, turning to the right or to the left,\nmarching ahead or wheeling back, kneeling or standing, with perfect\naccuracy and precision, not venturing to utter a sound. Then Sun Tzŭ\nsent a messenger to the King saying: \"Your soldiers, Sire, are now\nproperly drilled and disciplined, and ready for your majesty’s\ninspection. They can be put to any use that their sovereign may desire;\nbid them go through fire and water, and they will not disobey.\"\n\nBut the King replied: \"Let our general cease drilling and return to\ncamp. As for us, We have no wish to come down and inspect the troops.\"\n\nThereupon Sun Tzŭ said: \"The King is only fond of words, and cannot\ntranslate them into deeds.\"\n\nAfter that, Ho Lu saw that Sun Tzŭ was one who knew how to handle an\narmy, and finally appointed him general. In the west, he defeated the\nCh’u State and forced his way into Ying, the capital; to the north he\nput fear into the States of Ch’i and Chin, and spread his fame abroad\namongst the feudal princes. And Sun Tzŭ shared in the might of the\nKing.",
      "About Sun Tzŭ himself this is all that Ssu-ma Ch’ien has to tell us in\nthis chapter. But he proceeds to give a biography of his descendant,\nSun Pin, born about a hundred years after his famous ancestor’s death,\nand also the outstanding military genius of his time. The historian\nspeaks of him too as Sun Tzŭ, and in his preface we read: \"Sun Tzŭ had\nhis feet cut off and yet continued to discuss the art of war.\" [3] It\nseems likely, then, that \"Pin\" was a nickname bestowed on him after his\nmutilation, unless the story was invented in order to account for the\nname. The crowning incident of his career, the crushing defeat of his\ntreacherous rival P’ang Chuan, will be found briefly related in Chapter\nV. § 19, note.\n\nTo return to the elder Sun Tzŭ. He is mentioned in two other passages\nof the _Shih Chi:_—",
      "In the third year of his reign [512 B.C.] Ho Lu, king of Wu, took the\nfield with Tzŭ-hsu [i.e. Wu Yuan] and Po P’ei, and attacked Ch’u. He\ncaptured the town of Shu and slew the two prince’s sons who had\nformerly been generals of Wu. He was then meditating a descent on Ying\n[the capital]; but the general Sun Wu said: \"The army is exhausted. It\nis not yet possible. We must wait\"…. [After further successful\nfighting,] \"in the ninth year [506 B.C.], King Ho Lu addressed Wu\nTzŭ-hsu and Sun Wu, saying: \"Formerly, you declared that it was not yet\npossible for us to enter Ying. Is the time ripe now?\" The two men\nreplied: \"Ch’u’s general Tzŭ-ch’ang, [4] is grasping and covetous, and\nthe princes of T’ang and Ts’ai both have a grudge against him. If Your\nMajesty has resolved to make a grand attack, you must win over T’ang\nand Ts’ai, and then you may succeed.\" Ho Lu followed this advice, [beat\nCh’u in five pitched battles and marched into Ying.] [5]\n\nThis is the latest date at which anything is recorded of Sun Wu. He\ndoes not appear to have survived his patron, who died from the effects\nof a wound in 496. In another chapter there occurs this passage:[6]",
      "From this time onward, a number of famous soldiers arose, one after the\nother: Kao-fan, [7] who was employed by the Chin State; Wang-tzu, [8]\nin the service of Ch’i; and Sun Wu, in the service of Wu. These men\ndeveloped and threw light upon the principles of war.\n\nIt is obvious enough that Ssu-ma Ch’ien at least had no doubt about the\nreality of Sun Wu as an historical personage; and with one exception,\nto be noticed presently, he is by far the most important authority on\nthe period in question. It will not be necessary, therefore, to say\nmuch of such a work as the _Wu Yüeh Ch’un Ch’iu_, which is supposed to\nhave been written by Chao Yeh of the 1st century A.D. The attribution\nis somewhat doubtful; but even if it were otherwise, his account would\nbe of little value, based as it is on the _Shih Chi_ and expanded with\nromantic details. The story of Sun Tzŭ will be found, for what it is\nworth, in chapter 2. The only new points in it worth noting are: (1)\nSun Tzŭ was first recommended to Ho Lu by Wu Tzŭ-hsu. (2) He is called\na native of Wu. (3) He had previously lived a retired life, and his\ncontemporaries were unaware of his ability.",
      "The following passage occurs in the Huai-nan Tzŭ: \"When sovereign and\nministers show perversity of mind, it is impossible even for a Sun Tzŭ\nto encounter the foe.\" Assuming that this work is genuine (and hitherto\nno doubt has been cast upon it), we have here the earliest direct\nreference for Sun Tzŭ, for Huai-nan Tzŭ died in 122 B.C., many years\nbefore the _Shih Chi_ was given to the world.\n\nLiu Hsiang (80-9 B.C.) says: \"The reason why Sun Tzŭ at the head of\n30,000 men beat Ch’u with 200,000 is that the latter were\nundisciplined.\"\n\nTeng Ming-shih informs us that the surname \"Sun\" was bestowed on Sun\nWu’s grandfather by Duke Ching of Ch’i [547-490 B.C.]. Sun Wu’s father\nSun P’ing, rose to be a Minister of State in Ch’i, and Sun Wu himself,\nwhose style was Ch’ang-ch’ing, fled to Wu on account of the rebellion\nwhich was being fomented by the kindred of T’ien Pao. He had three\nsons, of whom the second, named Ming, was the father of Sun Pin.\nAccording to this account then, Pin was the grandson of Wu, which,\nconsidering that Sun Pin’s victory over Wei was gained in 341 B.C., may\nbe dismissed as chronologically impossible. Whence these data were\nobtained by Teng Ming-shih I do not know, but of course no reliance\nwhatever can be placed in them.",
      "An interesting document which has survived from the close of the Han\nperiod is the short preface written by the Great Ts’ao Ts’ao, or Wei Wu\nTi, for his edition of Sun Tzŭ. I shall give it in full:—\n\nI have heard that the ancients used bows and arrows to their advantage.\n[10] The _Lun Yu_ says: “There must be a sufficiency of military\nstrength.” The _Shu Ching_ mentions \"the army\" among the \"eight objects\nof government.\" The _I Ching_ says: \"‘army’ indicates firmness and\njustice; the experienced leader will have good fortune.\" The _Shih\nChing_ says: \"The King rose majestic in his wrath, and he marshalled his\ntroops.\" The Yellow Emperor, T’ang the Completer and Wu Wang all used\nspears and battle-axes in order to succour their generation. The _Ssu-ma\nFa_ says: \"If one man slay another of set purpose, he himself may\nrightfully be slain.\" He who relies solely on warlike measures shall be\nexterminated; he who relies solely on peaceful measures shall perish.\nInstances of this are Fu Ch’ai [11] on the one hand and Yen Wang on the\nother. [12] In military matters, the Sage’s rule is normally to keep\nthe peace, and to move his forces only when occasion requires. He will\nnot use armed force unless driven to it by necessity.",
      "Many books have I read on the subject of war and fighting; but the work\ncomposed by Sun Wu is the profoundest of them all. [Sun Tzŭ was a\nnative of the Ch’i state, his personal name was Wu. He wrote the _Art\nof War_ in 13 chapters for Ho Lu, King of Wu. Its principles were\ntested on women, and he was subsequently made a general. He led an army\nwestwards, crushed the Ch’u state and entered Ying the capital. In the\nnorth, he kept Ch’i and Chin in awe. A hundred years and more after his\ntime, Sun Pin lived. He was a descendant of Wu.] [13] In his treatment\nof deliberation and planning, the importance of rapidity in taking the\nfield, [14] clearness of conception, and depth of design, Sun Tzŭ\nstands beyond the reach of carping criticism. My contemporaries,\nhowever, have failed to grasp the full meaning of his instructions, and\nwhile putting into practice the smaller details in which his work\nabounds, they have overlooked its essential purport. That is the motive\nwhich has led me to outline a rough explanation of the whole.\n\nOne thing to be noticed in the above is the explicit statement that the\n13 chapters were specially composed for King Ho Lu. This is supported\nby the internal evidence of I. § 15, in which it seems clear that some\nruler is addressed.",
      "In the bibliographic section of the _Han Shu_, there is an entry which\nhas given rise to much discussion: \"The works of Sun Tzŭ of Wu in 82\n_p’ien_ (or chapters), with diagrams in 9 _chuan_.\" It is evident that\nthis cannot be merely the 13 chapters known to Ssu-ma Ch’ien, or those\nwe possess today. Chang Shou-chieh refers to an edition of Sun Tzŭ’s\n_Art of War_ of which the \"13 chapters\" formed the first _chuan_,\nadding that there were two other _chuan_ besides. This has brought\nforth a theory, that the bulk of these 82 chapters consisted of other\nwritings of Sun Tzŭ—we should call them apocryphal—similar to the _Wen\nTa_, of which a specimen dealing with the Nine Situations [15] is\npreserved in the _T’ung Tien_, and another in Ho Shin’s commentary. It\nis suggested that before his interview with Ho Lu, Sun Tzŭ had only\nwritten the 13 chapters, but afterwards composed a sort of exegesis in\nthe form of question and answer between himself and the King. Pi\nI-hsun, the author of the _Sun Tzŭ Hsu Lu_, backs this up with a\nquotation from the _Wu Yüeh Ch’un Ch’iu:_ \"The King of Wu summoned Sun\nTzŭ, and asked him questions about the art of war. Each time he set\nforth a chapter of his work, the King could not find words enough to\npraise him.\" As he points out, if the whole work was expounded on the\nsame scale as in the above-mentioned fragments, the total number of\nchapters could not fail to be considerable. Then the numerous other\ntreatises attributed to Sun Tzŭ might be included. The fact that the\n_Han Chih_ mentions no work of Sun Tzŭ except the 82 _p’ien_, whereas\nthe Sui and T’ang bibliographies give the titles of others in addition\nto the \"13 chapters,\" is good proof, Pi I-hsun thinks, that all of\nthese were contained in the 82 _p’ien_. Without pinning our faith to\nthe accuracy of details supplied by the _Wu Yüeh Ch’un Ch’iu_, or\nadmitting the genuineness of any of the treatises cited by Pi I-hsun,\nwe may see in this theory a probable solution of the mystery. Between\nSsu-ma Ch’ien and Pan Ku there was plenty of time for a luxuriant crop\nof forgeries to have grown up under the magic name of Sun Tzŭ, and the\n82 _p’ien_ may very well represent a collected edition of these lumped\ntogether with the original work. It is also possible, though less\nlikely, that some of them existed in the time of the earlier historian\nand were purposely ignored by him. [16]",
      "Tu Mu’s conjecture seems to be based on a passage which states: \"Wei Wu\nTi strung together Sun Wu’s _Art of War_,\" which in turn may have\nresulted from a misunderstanding of the final words of Ts’ao King’s\npreface. This, as Sun Hsing-yen points out, is only a modest way of\nsaying that he made an explanatory paraphrase, or in other words, wrote\na commentary on it. On the whole, this theory has met with very little\nacceptance. Thus, the _Ssu K’u Ch’uan Shu_ says: \"The mention of the 13\nchapters in the _Shih Chi_ shows that they were in existence before the\n_Han Chih_, and that latter accretions are not to be considered part of\nthe original work. Tu Mu’s assertion can certainly not be taken as\nproof.\"",
      "There is every reason to suppose, then, that the 13 chapters existed in\nthe time of Ssu-ma Ch’ien practically as we have them now. That the\nwork was then well known he tells us in so many words. \"Sun Tzŭ’s _13\nChapters_ and Wu Ch’i’s _Art of War_ are the two books that people\ncommonly refer to on the subject of military matters. Both of them are\nwidely distributed, so I will not discuss them here.\" But as we go\nfurther back, serious difficulties begin to arise. The salient fact\nwhich has to be faced is that the _Tso Chuan_, the greatest\ncontemporary record, makes no mention whatsoever of Sun Wu, either as a\ngeneral or as a writer. It is natural, in view of this awkward\ncircumstance, that many scholars should not only cast doubt on the\nstory of Sun Wu as given in the _Shih Chi_, but even show themselves\nfrankly skeptical as to the existence of the man at all. The most\npowerful presentment of this side of the case is to be found in the\nfollowing disposition by Yeh Shui-hsin: [17]—",
      "It is stated in Ssu-ma Ch’ien’s history that Sun Wu was a native of the\nCh’i State, and employed by Wu; and that in the reign of Ho Lu he\ncrushed Ch’u, entered Ying, and was a great general. But in Tso’s\nCommentary no Sun Wu appears at all. It is true that Tso’s Commentary\nneed not contain absolutely everything that other histories contain.\nBut Tso has not omitted to mention vulgar plebeians and hireling\nruffians such as Ying K’ao-shu, [18] Ts’ao Kuei, [19], Chu Chih-wu and\nChuan She-chu [20]. In the case of Sun Wu, whose fame and achievements\nwere so brilliant, the omission is much more glaring. Again, details\nare given, in their due order, about his contemporaries Wu Yuan and the\nMinister P’ei. [21] Is it credible that Sun Wu alone should have been\npassed over?\n\nIn point of literary style, Sun Tzŭ’s work belongs to the same school\nas _Kuan Tzŭ_, [22] _Liu T’ao_, [23] and the _Yüeh Yu_ [24] and may\nhave been the production of some private scholar living towards the end\nof the \"Spring and Autumn\" or the beginning of the \"Warring States\"\nperiod. [25] The story that his precepts were actually applied by the\nWu State, is merely the outcome of big talk on the part of his\nfollowers.",
      "From the flourishing period of the Chou dynasty [26] down to the time\nof the \"Spring and Autumn,\" all military commanders were statesmen as\nwell, and the class of professional generals, for conducting external\ncampaigns, did not then exist. It was not until the period of the \"Six\nStates\" [27] that this custom changed. Now although Wu was an\nuncivilized State, it is conceivable that Tso should have left\nunrecorded the fact that Sun Wu was a great general and yet held no\ncivil office? What we are told, therefore, about Jang-chu [28] and Sun\nWu, is not authentic matter, but the reckless fabrication of theorizing\npundits. The story of Ho Lu’s experiment on the women, in particular,\nis utterly preposterous and incredible.",
      "Yeh Shui-hsin represents Ssu-ma Ch’ien as having said that Sun Wu\ncrushed Ch’u and entered Ying. This is not quite correct. No doubt the\nimpression left on the reader’s mind is that he at least shared in\nthese exploits. The fact may or may not be significant; but it is\nnowhere explicitly stated in the _Shih Chi_ either that Sun Tzŭ was\ngeneral on the occasion of the taking of Ying, or that he even went\nthere at all. Moreover, as we know that Wu Yuan and Po P’ei both took\npart in the expedition, and also that its success was largely due to\nthe dash and enterprise of Fu Kai, Ho Lu’s younger brother, it is not\neasy to see how yet another general could have played a very prominent\npart in the same campaign.\n\nCh’en Chen-sun of the Sung dynasty has the note:—\n\nMilitary writers look upon Sun Wu as the father of their art. But the\nfact that he does not appear in the _Tso Chuan_, although he is said to\nhave served under Ho Lu King of Wu, makes it uncertain what period he\nreally belonged to.\n\nHe also says:—\n\nThe works of Sun Wu and Wu Ch’i may be of genuine antiquity.",
      "It is noticeable that both Yeh Shui-hsin and Ch’en Chen-sun, while\nrejecting the personality of Sun Wu as he figures in Ssu-ma Ch’ien’s\nhistory, are inclined to accept the date traditionally assigned to the\nwork which passes under his name. The author of the _Hsu Lu_ fails to\nappreciate this distinction, and consequently his bitter attack on\nCh’en Chen-sun really misses its mark. He makes one of two points,\nhowever, which certainly tell in favour of the high antiquity of our \"13\nchapters.\" \"Sun Tzŭ,\" he says, \"must have lived in the age of Ching\nWang [519-476], because he is frequently plagiarized in subsequent\nworks of the Chou, Ch’in and Han dynasties.\" The two most shameless\noffenders in this respect are Wu Ch’i and Huai-nan Tzŭ, both of them\nimportant historical personages in their day. The former lived only a\ncentury after the alleged date of Sun Tzŭ, and his death is known to\nhave taken place in 381 B.C. It was to him, according to Liu Hsiang,\nthat Tseng Shen delivered the _Tso Chuan_, which had been entrusted to\nhim by its author. [29] Now the fact that quotations from the _Art of\nWar_, acknowledged or otherwise, are to be found in so many authors of\ndifferent epochs, establishes a very strong anterior to them all,—in\nother words, that Sun Tzŭ’s treatise was already in existence towards\nthe end of the 5th century B.C. Further proof of Sun Tzŭ’s antiquity is\nfurnished by the archaic or wholly obsolete meanings attaching to a\nnumber of the words he uses. A list of these, which might perhaps be\nextended, is given in the _Hsu Lu;_ and though some of the\ninterpretations are doubtful, the main argument is hardly affected\nthereby. Again, it must not be forgotten that Yeh Shui-hsin, a scholar\nand critic of the first rank, deliberately pronounces the style of the\n13 chapters to belong to the early part of the fifth century. Seeing\nthat he is actually engaged in an attempt to disprove the existence of\nSun Wu himself, we may be sure that he would not have hesitated to\nassign the work to a later date had he not honestly believed the\ncontrary. And it is precisely on such a point that the judgment of an\neducated Chinaman will carry most weight. Other internal evidence is\nnot far to seek. Thus in XIII. § 1, there is an unmistakable allusion\nto the ancient system of land-tenure which had already passed away by\nthe time of Mencius, who was anxious to see it revived in a modified\nform. [30] The only warfare Sun Tzŭ knows is that carried on between\nthe various feudal princes, in which armored chariots play a large\npart. Their use seems to have entirely died out before the end of the\nChou dynasty. He speaks as a man of Wu, a state which ceased to exist\nas early as 473 B.C. On this I shall touch presently.",
      "But once refer the work to the 5th century or earlier, and the chances\nof its being other than a _bonâ fide_ production are sensibly\ndiminished. The great age of forgeries did not come until long after.\nThat it should have been forged in the period immediately following 473\nis particularly unlikely, for no one, as a rule, hastens to identify\nhimself with a lost cause. As for Yeh Shui-hsin’s theory, that the\nauthor was a literary recluse, that seems to me quite untenable. If one\nthing is more apparent than another after reading the maxims of Sun\nTzŭ, it is that their essence has been distilled from a large store of\npersonal observation and experience. They reflect the mind not only of\na born strategist, gifted with a rare faculty of generalization, but\nalso of a practical soldier closely acquainted with the military\nconditions of his time. To say nothing of the fact that these sayings\nhave been accepted and endorsed by all the greatest captains of Chinese\nhistory, they offer a combination of freshness and sincerity, acuteness\nand common sense, which quite excludes the idea that they were\nartificially concocted in the study. If we admit, then, that the 13\nchapters were the genuine production of a military man living towards\nthe end of the \"_Ch’un Ch’iu_\" period, are we not bound, in spite of\nthe silence of the _Tso Chuan_, to accept Ssu-ma Ch’ien’s account in\nits entirety? In view of his high repute as a sober historian, must we\nnot hesitate to assume that the records he drew upon for Sun Wu’s\nbiography were false and untrustworthy? The answer, I fear, must be in\nthe negative. There is still one grave, if not fatal, objection to the\nchronology involved in the story as told in the _Shih Chi_, which, so\nfar as I am aware, nobody has yet pointed out. There are two passages\nin Sun Tzŭ in which he alludes to contemporary affairs. The first in in\nVI. § 21:—",
      "Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yüeh exceed our own in\nnumber, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I\nsay then that victory can be achieved.\n\nThe other is in XI. § 30:—\n\nAsked if an army can be made to imitate the _shuai-jan_, I should\nanswer, Yes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yüeh are enemies; yet if\nthey are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm,\nthey will come to each other’s assistance just as the left hand helps\nthe right.",
      "These two paragraphs are extremely valuable as evidence of the date of\ncomposition. They assign the work to the period of the struggle between\nWu and Yüeh. So much has been observed by Pi I-hsun. But what has\nhitherto escaped notice is that they also seriously impair the\ncredibility of Ssu-ma Ch’ien’s narrative. As we have seen above, the\nfirst positive date given in connection with Sun Wu is 512 B.C. He is\nthen spoken of as a general, acting as confidential adviser to Ho Lu,\nso that his alleged introduction to that monarch had already taken\nplace, and of course the 13 chapters must have been written earlier\nstill. But at that time, and for several years after, down to the\ncapture of Ying in 506, Ch’u and not Yüeh, was the great hereditary\nenemy of Wu. The two states, Ch’u and Wu, had been constantly at war\nfor over half a century, [31] whereas the first war between Wu and Yüeh\nwas waged only in 510, [32] and even then was no more than a short\ninterlude sandwiched in the midst of the fierce struggle with Ch’u. Now\nCh’u is not mentioned in the 13 chapters at all. The natural inference\nis that they were written at a time when Yüeh had become the prime\nantagonist of Wu, that is, after Ch’u had suffered the great\nhumiliation of 506. At this point, a table of dates may be found\nuseful.",
      "B.C.\n514\tAccession of Ho Lu.\n512\tHo Lu attacks Ch’u, but is dissuaded from entering Ying,\nthe capital. Shih Chi mentions Sun Wu as general.\n511\tAnother attack on Ch’u.\n510\tWu makes a successful attack on Yüeh. This is the first\nwar between the two states.\n509 or 508\tCh’u invades Wu, but is signally defeated at Yu-chang.\n506\tHo Lu attacks Ch’u with the aid of T’ang and Ts’ai.\nDecisive battle of Po-chu, and capture of Ying. Last\nmention of Sun Wu in Shih Chi.\n505\tYüeh makes a raid on Wu in the absence of its army. Wu\nis beaten by Ch’in and evacuates Ying.\n504\tHo Lu sends Fu Ch’ai to attack Ch’u.\n497\tKou Chien becomes King of Yüeh.\n496\tWu attacks Yüeh, but is defeated by Kou Chien at Tsui-li.\nHo Lu is killed.\n494\tFu Ch’ai defeats Kou Chien in the great battle of Fu-\nchaio, and enters the capital of Yüeh.\n485 or 484\tKou Chien renders homage to Wu. Death of Wu Tzŭ-hsu.\n482\tKou Chien invades Wu in the absence of Fu Ch’ai.\n478 to 476\tFurther attacks by Yüeh on Wu.\n475\tKou Chien lays siege to the capital of Wu.\n473\tFinal defeat and extinction of Wu.",
      "The sentence quoted above from VI. § 21 hardly strikes me as one that\ncould have been written in the full flush of victory. It seems rather\nto imply that, for the moment at least, the tide had turned against Wu,\nand that she was getting the worst of the struggle. Hence we may\nconclude that our treatise was not in existence in 505, before which\ndate Yüeh does not appear to have scored any notable success against\nWu. Ho Lu died in 496, so that if the book was written for him, it must\nhave been during the period 505-496, when there was a lull in the\nhostilities, Wu having presumably exhausted by its supreme effort\nagainst Ch’u. On the other hand, if we choose to disregard the\ntradition connecting Sun Wu’s name with Ho Lu, it might equally well\nhave seen the light between 496 and 494, or possibly in the period\n482-473, when Yüeh was once again becoming a very serious menace. [33]\nWe may feel fairly certain that the author, whoever he may have been,\nwas not a man of any great eminence in his own day. On this point the\nnegative testimony of the _Tso Chuan_ far outweighs any shred of\nauthority still attaching to the _Shih Chi_, if once its other facts\nare discredited. Sun Hsing-yen, however, makes a feeble attempt to\nexplain the omission of his name from the great commentary. It was Wu\nTzŭ-hsu, he says, who got all the credit of Sun Wu’s exploits, because\nthe latter (being an alien) was not rewarded with an office in the\nState.",
      "How then did the Sun Tzŭ legend originate? It may be that the growing\ncelebrity of the book imparted by degrees a kind of factitious renown\nto its author. It was felt to be only right and proper that one so well\nversed in the science of war should have solid achievements to his\ncredit as well. Now the capture of Ying was undoubtedly the greatest\nfeat of arms in Ho Lu’s reign; it made a deep and lasting impression on\nall the surrounding states, and raised Wu to the short-lived zenith of\nher power. Hence, what more natural, as time went on, than that the\nacknowledged master of strategy, Sun Wu, should be popularly identified\nwith that campaign, at first perhaps only in the sense that his brain\nconceived and planned it; afterwards, that it was actually carried out\nby him in conjunction with Wu Yuan, [34] Po P’ei and Fu Kai?",
      "It is obvious that any attempt to reconstruct even the outline of Sun\nTzŭ’s life must be based almost wholly on conjecture. With this\nnecessary proviso, I should say that he probably entered the service of\nWu about the time of Ho Lu’s accession, and gathered experience, though\nonly in the capacity of a subordinate officer, during the intense\nmilitary activity which marked the first half of the prince’s reign.\n[35] If he rose to be a general at all, he certainly was never on an\nequal footing with the three above mentioned. He was doubtless present\nat the investment and occupation of Ying, and witnessed Wu’s sudden\ncollapse in the following year. Yüeh’s attack at this critical\njuncture, when her rival was embarrassed on every side, seems to have\nconvinced him that this upstart kingdom was the great enemy against\nwhom every effort would henceforth have to be directed. Sun Wu was thus\na well-seasoned warrior when he sat down to write his famous book,\nwhich according to my reckoning must have appeared towards the end,\nrather than the beginning of Ho Lu’s reign. The story of the women may\npossibly have grown out of some real incident occurring about the same\ntime. As we hear no more of Sun Wu after this from any source, he is\nhardly likely to have survived his patron or to have taken part in the\ndeath-struggle with Yüeh, which began with the disaster at Tsui-li.",
      "If these inferences are approximately correct, there is a certain irony\nin the fate which decreed that China’s most illustrious man of peace\nshould be contemporary with her greatest writer on war.\n\nThe Text of Sun Tzŭ\n\nI have found it difficult to glean much about the history of Sun Tzŭ’s\ntext. The quotations that occur in early authors go to show that the\n\"13 chapters\" of which Ssu-ma Ch’ien speaks were essentially the same\nas those now extant. We have his word for it that they were widely\ncirculated in his day, and can only regret that he refrained from\ndiscussing them on that account. Sun Hsing-yen says in his preface:—\n\nDuring the Ch’in and Han dynasties Sun Tzŭ’s _Art of War_ was in\ngeneral use amongst military commanders, but they seem to have treated\nit as a work of mysterious import, and were unwilling to expound it for\nthe benefit of posterity. Thus it came about that Wei Wu was the first\nto write a commentary on it.",
      "As we have already seen, there is no reasonable ground to suppose that\nTs’ao Kung tampered with the text. But the text itself is often so\nobscure, and the number of editions which appeared from that time\nonward so great, especially during the T’ang and Sung dynasties, that\nit would be surprising if numerous corruptions had not managed to creep\nin. Towards the middle of the Sung period, by which time all the chief\ncommentaries on Sun Tzŭ were in existence, a certain Chi T’ien-pao\npublished a work in 15 _chuan_ entitled \"Sun Tzŭ with the collected\ncommentaries of ten writers.\" There was another text, with variant\nreadings put forward by Chu Fu of Ta-hsing, which also had supporters\namong the scholars of that period; but in the Ming editions, Sun\nHsing-yen tells us, these readings were for some reason or other no\nlonger put into circulation. Thus, until the end of the 18th century,\nthe text in sole possession of the field was one derived from Chi\nT’ien-pao’s edition, although no actual copy of that important work was\nknown to have survived. That, therefore, is the text of Sun Tzŭ which\nappears in the War section of the great Imperial encyclopedia printed\nin 1726, the _Ku Chin T’u Shu Chi Ch’eng_. Another copy at my disposal\nof what is practically the same text, with slight variations, is that\ncontained in the \"Eleven philosophers of the Chou and Ch’in dynasties\"\n[1758]. And the Chinese printed in Capt. Calthrop’s first edition is\nevidently a similar version which has filtered through Japanese\nchannels. So things remained until Sun Hsing-yen [1752-1818], a\ndistinguished antiquarian and classical scholar, who claimed to be an\nactual descendant of Sun Wu, [36] accidentally discovered a copy of Chi\nT’ien-pao’s long-lost work, when on a visit to the library of the\nHua-yin temple. [37] Appended to it was the _I Shuo_ of Cheng Yu-Hsien,\nmentioned in the _T’ung Chih_, and also believed to have perished. This\nis what Sun Hsing-yen designates as the \"original edition (or text)\"—a\nrather misleading name, for it cannot by any means claim to set before\nus the text of Sun Tzŭ in its pristine purity. Chi T’ien-pao was a\ncareless compiler, and appears to have been content to reproduce the\nsomewhat debased version current in his day, without troubling to\ncollate it with the earliest editions then available. Fortunately, two\nversions of Sun Tzŭ, even older than the newly discovered work, were\nstill extant, one buried in the _T’ung Tien_, Tu Yu’s great treatise on\nthe Constitution, the other similarly enshrined in the _T’ai P’ing Yu\nLan_ encyclopedia. In both the complete text is to be found, though\nsplit up into fragments, intermixed with other matter, and scattered\npiecemeal over a number of different sections. Considering that the _Yu\nLan_ takes us back to the year 983, and the _T’ung Tien_ about 200\nyears further still, to the middle of the T’ang dynasty, the value of\nthese early transcripts of Sun Tzŭ can hardly be overestimated. Yet the\nidea of utilizing them does not seem to have occurred to anyone until\nSun Hsing-yen, acting under Government instructions, undertook a\nthorough recension of the text. This is his own account:—",
      "Because of the numerous mistakes in the text of Sun Tzŭ which his\neditors had handed down, the Government ordered that the ancient\nedition [of Chi T’ien-pao] should be used, and that the text should be\nrevised and corrected throughout. It happened that Wu Nien-hu, the\nGovernor Pi Kua, and Hsi, a graduate of the second degree, had all\ndevoted themselves to this study, probably surpassing me therein.\nAccordingly, I have had the whole work cut on blocks as a textbook for\nmilitary men.\n\nThe three individuals here referred to had evidently been occupied on\nthe text of Sun Tzŭ prior to Sun Hsing-yen’s commission, but we are\nleft in doubt as to the work they really accomplished. At any rate, the\nnew edition, when ultimately produced, appeared in the names of Sun\nHsing-yen and only one co-editor Wu Jen-shi. They took the \"original\nedition\" as their basis, and by careful comparison with older versions,\nas well as the extant commentaries and other sources of information\nsuch as the _I Shuo_, succeeded in restoring a very large number of\ndoubtful passages, and turned out, on the whole, what must be accepted\nas the closest approximation we are ever likely to get to Sun Tzŭ’s\noriginal work. This is what will hereafter be denominated the \"standard\ntext.\"",
      "The copy which I have used belongs to a reissue dated 1877. It is in 6\n_pen_, forming part of a well-printed set of 23 early philosophical\nworks in 83 _pen_. [38] It opens with a preface by Sun Hsing-yen\n(largely quoted in this introduction), vindicating the traditional view\nof Sun Tzŭ’s life and performances, and summing up in remarkably\nconcise fashion the evidence in its favour. This is followed by Ts’ao\nKung’s preface to his edition, and the biography of Sun Tzŭ from the\n_Shih Chi_, both translated above. Then come, firstly, Cheng Yu-hsien’s\n_I Shuo_, [39] with author’s preface, and next, a short miscellany of\nhistorical and bibliographical information entitled _Sun Tzŭ Hsu Lu_,\ncompiled by Pi I-hsun. As regards the body of the work, each separate\nsentence is followed by a note on the text, if required, and then by\nthe various commentaries appertaining to it, arranged in chronological\norder. These we shall now proceed to discuss briefly, one by one.\n\nThe Commentators\n\nSun Tzŭ can boast an exceptionally long distinguished roll of\ncommentators, which would do honour to any classic. Ou-yang Hsiu remarks\non this fact, though he wrote before the tale was complete, and rather\ningeniously explains it by saying that the artifices of war, being\ninexhaustible, must therefore be susceptible of treatment in a great\nvariety of ways.",
      "1. TS’AO TS’AO or Ts’ao Kung, afterwards known as Wei Wu Ti [A.D.\n155-220]. There is hardly any room for doubt that the earliest\ncommentary on Sun Tzŭ actually came from the pen of this extraordinary\nman, whose biography in the _San Kuo Chih_ reads like a romance. One of\nthe greatest military geniuses that the world has seen, and Napoleonic\nin the scale of his operations, he was especially famed for the\nmarvelous rapidity of his marches, which has found expression in the\nline \"Talk of Ts’ao Ts’ao, and Ts’ao Ts’ao will appear.\" Ou-yang Hsiu\nsays of him that he was a great captain who \"measured his strength\nagainst Tung Cho, Lu Pu and the two Yuan, father and son, and\nvanquished them all; whereupon he divided the Empire of Han with Wu and\nShu, and made himself king. It is recorded that whenever a council of\nwar was held by Wei on the eve of a far-reaching campaign, he had all\nhis calculations ready; those generals who made use of them did not\nlose one battle in ten; those who ran counter to them in any particular\nsaw their armies incontinently beaten and put to flight.\" Ts’ao Kung’s\nnotes on Sun Tzŭ, models of austere brevity, are so thoroughly\ncharacteristic of the stern commander known to history, that it is hard\nindeed to conceive of them as the work of a mere _littérateur_.\nSometimes, indeed, owing to extreme compression, they are scarcely\nintelligible and stand no less in need of a commentary than the text\nitself. [40]",
      "2. MENG SHIH. The commentary which has come down to us under this name\nis comparatively meager, and nothing about the author is known. Even\nhis personal name has not been recorded. Chi T’ien-pao’s edition places\nhim after Chia Lin, and Ch’ao Kung-wu also assigns him to the T’ang\ndynasty, [41] but this is a mistake. In Sun Hsing-yen’s preface, he\nappears as Meng Shih of the Liang dynasty [502-557]. Others would\nidentify him with Meng K’ang of the 3rd century. He is named in one\nwork as the last of the \"Five Commentators,\" the others being Wei Wu\nTi, Tu Mu, Ch’en Hao and Chia Lin.\n\n3. LI CH’UAN of the 8th century was a well-known writer on military\ntactics. One of his works has been in constant use down to the present\nday. The _T’ung Chih_ mentions \"Lives of famous generals from the Chou\nto the T’ang dynasty\" as written by him. [42] According to Ch’ao\nKung-wu and the _T’ien-i-ko_ catalogue, he followed a variant of the\ntext of Sun Tzŭ which differs considerably from those now extant. His\nnotes are mostly short and to the point, and he frequently illustrates\nhis remarks by anecdotes from Chinese history.",
      "4. TU YU (died 812) did not publish a separate commentary on Sun Tzŭ,\nhis notes being taken from the _T’ung Tien_, the encyclopedic treatise\non the Constitution which was his life-work. They are largely\nrepetitions of Ts’ao Kung and Meng Shih, besides which it is believed\nthat he drew on the ancient commentaries of Wang Ling and others. Owing\nto the peculiar arrangement of _T’ung Tien_, he has to explain each\npassage on its merits, apart from the context, and sometimes his own\nexplanation does not agree with that of Ts’ao Kung, whom he always\nquotes first. Though not strictly to be reckoned as one of the \"Ten\nCommentators,\" he was added to their number by Chi T’ien-pao, being\nwrongly placed after his grandson Tu Mu.",
      "5. TU MU (803-852) is perhaps the best known as a poet—a bright star\neven in the glorious galaxy of the T’ang period. We learn from Ch’ao\nKung-wu that although he had no practical experience of war, he was\nextremely fond of discussing the subject, and was moreover well read in\nthe military history of the _Ch’un Ch’iu_ and _Chan Kuo_ eras. His\nnotes, therefore, are well worth attention. They are very copious, and\nreplete with historical parallels. The gist of Sun Tzŭ’s work is thus\nsummarized by him: \"Practice benevolence and justice, but on the other\nhand make full use of artifice and measures of expediency.\" He further\ndeclared that all the military triumphs and disasters of the thousand\nyears which had elapsed since Sun Tzŭ’s death would, upon examination,\nbe found to uphold and corroborate, in every particular, the maxims\ncontained in his book. Tu Mu’s somewhat spiteful charge against Ts’ao\nKung has already been considered elsewhere.",
      "6. CH’EN HAO appears to have been a contemporary of Tu Mu. Ch’ao\nKung-wu says that he was impelled to write a new commentary on Sun Tzŭ\nbecause Ts’ao Kung’s on the one hand was too obscure and subtle, and\nthat of Tu Mu on the other too long-winded and diffuse. Ou-yang Hsiu,\nwriting in the middle of the 11th century, calls Ts’ao Kung, Tu Mu and\nCh’en Hao the three chief commentators on Sun Tzŭ, and observes that\nCh’en Hao is continually attacking Tu Mu’s shortcomings. His\ncommentary, though not lacking in merit, must rank below those of his\npredecessors.\n\n7. CHIA LIN is known to have lived under the T’ang dynasty, for his\ncommentary on Sun Tzŭ is mentioned in the _T’ang Shu_ and was\nafterwards republished by Chi Hsieh of the same dynasty together with\nthose of Meng Shih and Tu Yu. It is of somewhat scanty texture, and in\npoint of quality, too, perhaps the least valuable of the eleven.\n\n8. MEI YAO-CH’EN (1002-1060), commonly known by his \"style\" as Mei\nSheng-yu, was, like Tu Mu, a poet of distinction. His commentary was\npublished with a laudatory preface by the great Ou-yang Hsiu, from\nwhich we may cull the following:—",
      "Later scholars have misread Sun Tzŭ, distorting his words and trying to\nmake them square with their own one-sided views. Thus, though\ncommentators have not been lacking, only a few have proved equal to the\ntask. My friend Sheng-yu has not fallen into this mistake. In\nattempting to provide a critical commentary for Sun Tzŭ’s work, he does\nnot lose sight of the fact that these sayings were intended for states\nengaged in internecine warfare; that the author is not concerned with\nthe military conditions prevailing under the sovereigns of the three\nancient dynasties, [43] nor with the nine punitive measures prescribed\nto the Minister of War. [44] Again, Sun Wu loved brevity of diction,\nbut his meaning is always deep. Whether the subject be marching an\narmy, or handling soldiers, or estimating the enemy, or controlling the\nforces of victory, it is always systematically treated; the sayings are\nbound together in strict logical sequence, though this has been\nobscured by commentators who have probably failed to grasp their\nmeaning. In his own commentary, Mei Sheng-yu has brushed aside all the\nobstinate prejudices of these critics, and has tried to bring out the\ntrue meaning of Sun Tzŭ himself. In this way, the clouds of confusion\nhave been dispersed and the sayings made clear. I am convinced that the\npresent work deserves to be handed down side by side with the three\ngreat commentaries; and for a great deal that they find in the sayings,\ncoming generations will have constant reason to thank my friend\nSheng-yu.",
      "Making some allowance for the exuberance of friendship, I am inclined\nto endorse this favourable judgment, and would certainly place him above\nCh’en Hao in order of merit.\n\n9. WANG HSI, also of the Sung dynasty, is decidedly original in some of\nhis interpretations, but much less judicious than Mei Yao-ch’en, and on\nthe whole not a very trustworthy guide. He is fond of comparing his own\ncommentary with that of Ts’ao Kung, but the comparison is not often\nflattering to him. We learn from Ch’ao Kung-wu that Wang Hsi revised\nthe ancient text of Sun Tzŭ, filling up lacunae and correcting\nmistakes. [45]\n\n10. HO YEN-HSI of the Sung dynasty. The personal name of this\ncommentator is given as above by Cheng Ch’iao in the _Tung Chih_,\nwritten about the middle of the twelfth century, but he appears simply\nas Ho Shih in the _Yu Hai_, and Ma Tuan-lin quotes Ch’ao Kung-wu as\nsaying that his personal name is unknown. There seems to be no reason\nto doubt Cheng Ch’iao’s statement, otherwise I should have been\ninclined to hazard a guess and identify him with one Ho Ch’u-fei, the\nauthor of a short treatise on war, who lived in the latter part of the\n11th century. Ho Shih’s commentary, in the words of the _T’ien-i-ko_\ncatalogue, \"contains helpful additions\" here and there, but is chiefly\nremarkable for the copious extracts taken, in adapted form, from the\ndynastic histories and other sources.",
      "11. CHANG YU. The list closes with a commentator of no great\noriginality perhaps, but gifted with admirable powers of lucid\nexposition. His commentator is based on that of Ts’ao Kung, whose terse\nsentences he contrives to expand and develop in masterly fashion.\nWithout Chang Yu, it is safe to say that much of Ts’ao Kung’s\ncommentary would have remained cloaked in its pristine obscurity and\ntherefore valueless. His work is not mentioned in the Sung history, the\n_T’ung K’ao_, or the _Yu Hai_, but it finds a niche in the _T’ung\nChih_, which also names him as the author of the \"Lives of Famous\nGenerals.\" [46]\n\nIt is rather remarkable that the last-named four should all have\nflourished within so short a space of time. Ch’ao Kung-wu accounts for\nit by saying: \"During the early years of the Sung dynasty the Empire\nenjoyed a long spell of peace, and men ceased to practice the art of\nwar. but when [Chao] Yuan-hao’s rebellion came [1038-42] and the\nfrontier generals were defeated time after time, the Court made\nstrenuous inquiry for men skilled in war, and military topics became\nthe vogue amongst all the high officials. Hence it is that the\ncommentators of Sun Tzŭ in our dynasty belong mainly to that period.\n[47]",
      "Besides these eleven commentators, there are several others whose work\nhas not come down to us. The _Sui Shu_ mentions four, namely Wang Ling\n(often quoted by Tu Yu as Wang Tzŭ); Chang Tzŭ-shang; Chia Hsu of Wei;\n[48] and Shen Yu of Wu. The _T’ang Shu_ adds Sun Hao, and the _T’ung\nChih_ Hsiao Chi, while the _T’u Shu_ mentions a Ming commentator, Huang\nJun-yu. It is possible that some of these may have been merely\ncollectors and editors of other commentaries, like Chi T’ien-pao and\nChi Hsieh, mentioned above.\n\nAppreciations of Sun Tzŭ\n\nSun Tzŭ has exercised a potent fascination over the minds of some of\nChina’s greatest men. Among the famous generals who are known to have\nstudied his pages with enthusiasm may be mentioned Han Hsin (_d_. 196\nB.C.), [49] Feng I (_d_. 34 A.D.), [50] Lu Meng (_d_. 219), [51] and Yo\nFei (1103-1141). [52] The opinion of Ts’ao Kung, who disputes with Han\nHsin the highest place in Chinese military annals, has already been\nrecorded. [53] Still more remarkable, in one way, is the testimony of\npurely literary men, such as Su Hsun (the father of Su Tung-p’o), who\nwrote several essays on military topics, all of which owe their chief\ninspiration to Sun Tzŭ. The following short passage by him is preserved\nin the _Yu Hai:_ [54]—",
      "Sun Wu’s saying, that in war one cannot make certain of conquering,\n[55] is very different indeed from what other books tell us. [56] Wu\nCh’i was a man of the same stamp as Sun Wu: they both wrote books on\nwar, and they are linked together in popular speech as \"Sun and Wu.\"\nBut Wu Ch’i’s remarks on war are less weighty, his rules are rougher\nand more crudely stated, and there is not the same unity of plan as in\nSun Tzŭ’s work, where the style is terse, but the meaning fully brought\nout.\n\nThe following is an extract from the \"Impartial Judgments in the Garden\nof Literature\" by Cheng Hou:—\n\nSun Tzŭ’s 13 chapters are not only the staple and base of all military\nmen’s training, but also compel the most careful attention of scholars\nand men of letters. His sayings are terse yet elegant, simple yet\nprofound, perspicuous and eminently practical. Such works as the _Lun\nYu_, the _I Ching_ and the great Commentary, [57] as well as the\nwritings of Mencius, Hsun K’uang and Yang Chu, all fall below the level\nof Sun Tzŭ.\n\nChu Hsi, commenting on this, fully admits the first part of the\ncriticism, although he dislikes the audacious comparison with the\nvenerated classical works. Language of this sort, he says, \"encourages\na ruler’s bent towards unrelenting warfare and reckless militarism.\"\n\nApologies for War",
      "Accustomed as we are to think of China as the greatest peace-loving\nnation on earth, we are in some danger of forgetting that her\nexperience of war in all its phases has also been such as no modern\nState can parallel. Her long military annals stretch back to a point at\nwhich they are lost in the mists of time. She had built the Great Wall\nand was maintaining a huge standing army along her frontier centuries\nbefore the first Roman legionary was seen on the Danube. What with the\nperpetual collisions of the ancient feudal States, the grim conflicts\nwith Huns, Turks and other invaders after the centralization of\ngovernment, the terrific upheavals which accompanied the overthrow of\nso many dynasties, besides the countless rebellions and minor\ndisturbances that have flamed up and flickered out again one by one, it\nis hardly too much to say that the clash of arms has never ceased to\nresound in one portion or another of the Empire.",
      "No less remarkable is the succession of illustrious captains to whom\nChina can point with pride. As in all countries, the greatest are fond\nof emerging at the most fateful crises of her history. Thus, Po Ch’i\nstands out conspicuous in the period when Ch’in was entering upon her\nfinal struggle with the remaining independent states. The stormy years\nwhich followed the break-up of the Ch’in dynasty are illuminated by the\ntranscendent genius of Han Hsin. When the House of Han in turn is\ntottering to its fall, the great and baleful figure of Ts’ao Ts’ao\ndominates the scene. And in the establishment of the T’ang dynasty, one\nof the mightiest tasks achieved by man, the superhuman energy of Li\nShih-min (afterwards the Emperor T’ai Tsung) was seconded by the\nbrilliant strategy of Li Ching. None of these generals need fear\ncomparison with the greatest names in the military history of Europe.",
      "In spite of all this, the great body of Chinese sentiment, from Lao Tzŭ\ndownwards, and especially as reflected in the standard literature of\nConfucianism, has been consistently pacific and intensely opposed to\nmilitarism in any form. It is such an uncommon thing to find any of the\nliterati defending warfare on principle, that I have thought it worth\nwhile to collect and translate a few passages in which the unorthodox\nview is upheld. The following, by Ssu-ma Ch’ien, shows that for all his\nardent admiration of Confucius, he was yet no advocate of peace at any\nprice:—",
      "Military weapons are the means used by the Sage to punish violence and\ncruelty, to give peace to troublous times, to remove difficulties and\ndangers, and to succour those who are in peril. Every animal with blood\nin its veins and horns on its head will fight when it is attacked. How\nmuch more so will man, who carries in his breast the faculties of love\nand hatred, joy and anger! When he is pleased, a feeling of affection\nsprings up within him; when angry, his poisoned sting is brought into\nplay. That is the natural law which governs his being…. What then shall\nbe said of those scholars of our time, blind to all great issues, and\nwithout any appreciation of relative values, who can only bark out\ntheir stale formulas about \"virtue\" and \"civilization,\" condemning the\nuse of military weapons? They will surely bring our country to\nimpotence and dishonour and the loss of her rightful heritage; or, at\nthe very least, they will bring about invasion and rebellion, sacrifice\nof territory and general enfeeblement. Yet they obstinately refuse to\nmodify the position they have taken up. The truth is that, just as in\nthe family the teacher must not spare the rod, and punishments cannot\nbe dispensed with in the State, so military chastisement can never be\nallowed to fall into abeyance in the Empire. All one can say is that\nthis power will be exercised wisely by some, foolishly by others, and\nthat among those who bear arms some will be loyal and others\nrebellious. [58]",
      "The next piece is taken from Tu Mu’s preface to his commentary on Sun\nTzŭ:—\n\nWar may be defined as punishment, which is one of the functions of\ngovernment. It was the profession of Chung Yu and Jan Ch’iu, both\ndisciples of Confucius. Nowadays, the holding of trials and hearing of\nlitigation, the imprisonment of offenders and their execution by\nflogging in the market-place, are all done by officials. But the\nwielding of huge armies, the throwing down of fortified cities, the\nhauling of women and children into captivity, and the beheading of\ntraitors—this is also work which is done by officials. The objects of\nthe rack and of military weapons are essentially the same. There is no\nintrinsic difference between the punishment of flogging and cutting off\nheads in war. For the lesser infractions of law, which are easily dealt\nwith, only a small amount of force need be employed: hence the use of\nmilitary weapons and wholesale decapitation. In both cases, however,\nthe end in view is to get rid of wicked people, and to give comfort and\nrelief to the good….",
      "Chi-sun asked Jan Yu, saying: \"Have you, Sir, acquired your military\naptitude by study, or is it innate?\" Jan Yu replied: \"It has been\nacquired by study.\" [59] \"How can that be so,\" said Chi-sun, \"seeing\nthat you are a disciple of Confucius?\" \"It is a fact,\" replied Jan Yu;\n\"I was taught by Confucius. It is fitting that the great Sage should\nexercise both civil and military functions, though to be sure my\ninstruction in the art of fighting has not yet gone very far.\"\n\nNow, who the author was of this rigid distinction between the \"civil\"\nand the \"military,\" and the limitation of each to a separate sphere of\naction, or in what year of which dynasty it was first introduced, is\nmore than I can say. But, at any rate, it has come about that the\nmembers of the governing class are quite afraid of enlarging on\nmilitary topics, or do so only in a shamefaced manner. If any are bold\nenough to discuss the subject, they are at once set down as eccentric\nindividuals of coarse and brutal propensities. This is an extraordinary\ninstance in which, through sheer lack of reasoning, men unhappily lose\nsight of fundamental principles.",
      "When the Duke of Chou was minister under Ch’eng Wang, he regulated\nceremonies and made music, and venerated the arts of scholarship and\nlearning; yet when the barbarians of the River Huai revolted, [60] he\nsallied forth and chastised them. When Confucius held office under the\nDuke of Lu, and a meeting was convened at Chia-ku, [61] he said: \"If\npacific negotiations are in progress, warlike preparations should have\nbeen made beforehand.\" He rebuked and shamed the Marquis of Ch’i, who\ncowered under him and dared not proceed to violence. How can it be said\nthat these two great Sages had no knowledge of military matters?\n\nWe have seen that the great Chu Hsi held Sun Tzŭ in high esteem. He\nalso appeals to the authority of the Classics:—",
      "Our Master Confucius, answering Duke Ling of Wei, said: \"I have never\nstudied matters connected with armies and battalions.\" [62] Replying to\nK’ung Wen-tzu, he said: I have not been instructed about buff-coats and\nweapons.\" But if we turn to the meeting at Chia-ku, we find that he\nused armed force against the men of Lai, so that the marquis of Ch’i\nwas overawed. Again, when the inhabitants of Pi revolted; he ordered\nhis officers to attack them, whereupon they were defeated and fled in\nconfusion. He once uttered the words: \"If I fight, I conquer.\" [63] And\nJan Yu also said: \"The Sage exercises both civil and military\nfunctions.\" [64] Can it be a fact that Confucius never studied or\nreceived instruction in the art of war? We can only say that he did not\nspecially choose matters connected with armies and fighting to be the\nsubject of his teaching.\n\nSun Hsing-yen, the editor of Sun Tzŭ, writes in similar strain:—",
      "Confucius said: \"I am unversed in military matters.\" [65] He also said:\n\"If I fight, I conquer.\" Confucius ordered ceremonies and regulated\nmusic. Now war constitutes one of the five classes of State ceremonial,\n[66] and must not be treated as an independent branch of study. Hence,\nthe words \"I am unversed in\" must be taken to mean that there are\nthings which even an inspired Teacher does not know. Those who have to\nlead an army and devise stratagems, must learn the art of war. But if\none can command the services of a good general like Sun Tzŭ, who was\nemployed by Wu Tzŭ-hsu, there is no need to learn it oneself. Hence the\nremark added by Confucius: \"If I fight, I conquer.\"",
      "The men of the present day, however, willfully interpret these words of\nConfucius in their narrowest sense, as though he meant that books on\nthe art of war were not worth reading. With blind persistency, they\nadduce the example of Chao Kua, who pored over his father’s books to no\npurpose, [67] as a proof that all military theory is useless. Again,\nseeing that books on war have to do with such things as opportunism in\ndesigning plans, and the conversion of spies, they hold that the art is\nimmoral and unworthy of a sage. These people ignore the fact that the\nstudies of our scholars and the civil administration of our officials\nalso require steady application and practice before efficiency is\nreached. The ancients were particularly chary of allowing mere novices\nto botch their work. [68] Weapons are baneful [69] and fighting\nperilous; and useless unless a general is in constant practice, he\nought not to hazard other men’s lives in battle. [70] Hence it is\nessential that Sun Tzŭ’s 13 chapters should be studied.",
      "Hsiang Liang used to instruct his nephew Chi [71] in the art of war.\nChi got a rough idea of the art in its general bearings, but would not\npursue his studies to their proper outcome, the consequence being that\nhe was finally defeated and overthrown. He did not realize that the\ntricks and artifices of war are beyond verbal computation. Duke Hsiang\nof Sung and King Yen of Hsu were brought to destruction by their\nmisplaced humanity. The treacherous and underhand nature of war\nnecessitates the use of guile and stratagem suited to the occasion.\nThere is a case on record of Confucius himself having violated an\nextorted oath, [72] and also of his having left the Sung State in\ndisguise. [73] Can we then recklessly arraign Sun Tzŭ for disregarding\ntruth and honesty?\n\nBibliography\n\nThe following are the oldest Chinese treatises on war, after Sun Tzŭ.\nThe notes on each have been drawn principally from the _Ssu k’u ch’uan\nshu chien ming mu lu_, ch. 9, fol. 22 sqq.\n\n1. _Wu Tzŭ_, in 1 _chuan_ or 6 chapters. By Wu Ch’i (_d_. 381 B.C.). A\ngenuine work. See _Shih Chi_, ch. 65.\n\n2. _Ssu-ma Fa_, in 1 _chuan_ or 5 chapters. Wrongly attributed to\nSsu-ma Jang-chu of the 6th century B.C. Its date, however, must be\nearly, as the customs of the three ancient dynasties are constantly to\nbe met within its pages. See _Shih Chi_, ch. 64.",
      "The _Ssu K’u Ch’uan Shu_ (ch. 99, f. 1) remarks that the oldest three\ntreatises on war, _Sun Tzŭ_, _Wu Tzŭ_ and _Ssu-ma Fa_, are, generally\nspeaking, only concerned with things strictly military—the art of\nproducing, collecting, training and drilling troops, and the correct\ntheory with regard to measures of expediency, laying plans, transport\nof goods and the handling of soldiers—in strong contrast to later\nworks, in which the science of war is usually blended with metaphysics,\ndivination and magical arts in general.\n\n3. _Liu T’ao_, in 6 _chuan_, or 60 chapters. Attributed to Lu Wang (or\nLu Shang, also known as T’ai Kung) of the 12th century B.C. [74] But\nits style does not belong to the era of the Three Dynasties. Lu Te-ming\n(550-625 A.D.) mentions the work, and enumerates the headings of the\nsix sections so that the forgery cannot have been later than Sui\ndynasty.\n\n4. _Wei Liao Tzŭ_, in 5 _chuan_. Attributed to Wei Liao (4th cent.\nB.C.), who studied under the famous Kuei-ku Tzŭ. The work appears to\nhave been originally in 31 chapters, whereas the text we possess\ncontains only 24. Its matter is sound enough in the main, though the\nstrategical devices differ considerably from those of the Warring\nStates period. It is been furnished with a commentary by the well-known\nSung philosopher Chang Tsai.",
      "5. _San Lueh_ in 3 _chuan_. Attributed to Huang-shih Kung, a legendary\npersonage who is said to have bestowed it on Chang Liang (_d_. 187\nB.C.) in an interview on a bridge. But here again, the style is not\nthat of works dating from the Ch’in or Han period. The Han Emperor\nKuang Wu [25-57 A.D.] apparently quotes from it in one of his\nproclamations; but the passage in question may have been inserted later\non, in order to prove the genuineness of the work. We shall not be far\nout if we refer it to the Northern Sung period [420-478 A.D.], or\nsomewhat earlier.\n\n6. _Li Wei Kung Wen Tui_, in 3 sections. Written in the form of a\ndialogue between T’ai Tsung and his great general Li Ching, it is\nusually ascribed to the latter. Competent authorities consider it a\nforgery, though the author was evidently well versed in the art of war.\n\n7. _Li Ching Ping Fa_ (not to be confounded with the foregoing) is a\nshort treatise in 8 chapters, preserved in the T’ung Tien, but not\npublished separately. This fact explains its omission from the _Ssu K’u\nCh’uan Shu_.",
      "8. _Wu Ch’i Ching_, in 1 _chuan_. Attributed to the legendary minister\nFeng Hou, with exegetical notes by Kung-sun Hung of the Han dynasty\n(_d_. 121 B.C.), and said to have been eulogized by the celebrated\ngeneral Ma Lung (_d_. 300 A.D.). Yet the earliest mention of it is in\nthe _Sung Chih_. Although a forgery, the work is well put together.\n\nConsidering the high popular estimation in which Chu-ko Liang has\nalways been held, it is not surprising to find more than one work on\nwar ascribed to his pen. Such are (1) the _Shih Liu Ts’e_ (1 _chuan_),\npreserved in the _Yung Lo Ta Tien;_ (2) _Chiang Yuan_ (1 _chuan_); and\n(3) _Hsin Shu_ (1 _chuan_), which steals wholesale from Sun Tzŭ. None\nof these has the slightest claim to be considered genuine.\n\nMost of the large Chinese encyclopedias contain extensive sections\ndevoted to the literature of war.

When Wu first appears in the _Ch’un Ch’iu_ in 584, it is already at\nvariance with its powerful neighbour. The _Ch’un Ch’iu_ first mentions\nYüeh in 537, the _Tso Chuan_ in 601.\n\n32. This is explicitly stated in the _Tso Chuan_, XXXII, 2.\n\n33. There is this to be said for the later period, that the feud would\ntend to grow more bitter after each encounter, and thus more fully\njustify the language used in XI. § 30.\n\n34. With Wu Yuan himself the case is just the reverse:—a spurious\ntreatise on war has been fathered on him simply because he was a great\ngeneral. Here we have an obvious inducement to forgery. Sun Wu, on the\nother hand, cannot have been widely known to fame in the 5th century.\n\n35.

The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be\ntaken into account in one’s deliberations, when seeking to determine\nthe conditions obtaining in the field.\n\n4. These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The\nCommander; (5) Method and discipline.\n\n[It appears from what follows that Sun Tzŭ means by \"Moral Law\" a\nprinciple of harmony, not unlike the Tao of Lao Tzŭ in its moral\naspect. One might be tempted to render it by \"morale,\" were it not\nconsidered as an attribute of the _ruler_ in § 13.]\n\n5, 6. _The Moral Law_ causes the people to be in complete accord with\ntheir ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives,\nundismayed by any danger.\n\n[Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzŭ as saying: \"Without constant practice, the\nofficers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle;\nwithout constant practice, the general will be wavering and irresolute\nwhen the crisis is at hand.\"]\n\n7. _Heaven_ signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.",
      "[The commentators, I think, make an unnecessary mystery of two words\nhere. Meng Shih refers to \"the hard and the soft, waxing and waning\" of\nHeaven. Wang Hsi, however, may be right in saying that what is meant is\n\"the general economy of Heaven,\" including the five elements, the four\nseasons, wind and clouds, and other phenomena.]\n\n8. _Earth_ comprises distances, great and small; danger and security;\nopen ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.\n\n9. _The Commander_ stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity,\nbenevolence, courage and strictness.\n\n[The five cardinal virtues of the Chinese are (1) humanity or\nbenevolence; (2) uprightness of mind; (3) self-respect, self-control,\nor \"proper feeling;\" (4) wisdom; (5) sincerity or good faith. Here\n\"wisdom\" and \"sincerity\" are put before \"humanity or benevolence,\" and\nthe two military virtues of \"courage\" and \"strictness\" substituted for\n\"uprightness of mind\" and \"self-respect, self-control, or ‘proper\nfeeling.’\"]\n\n10. By _Method and discipline_ are to be understood the marshalling of\nthe army in its proper subdivisions, the gradations of rank among the\nofficers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the\narmy, and the control of military expenditure.\n\n11. These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows\nthem will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.",
      "12. Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the\nmilitary conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in\nthis wise:—\n\n13. (1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law?\n\n[I.e., \"is in harmony with his subjects.\" Cf. § 5.]\n\n(2) Which of the two generals has most ability?\n    (3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth?\n\n[See §§ 7, 8]\n\n(4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?\n\n[Tu Mu alludes to the remarkable story of Ts’ao Ts’ao (A.D. 155-220),\nwho was such a strict disciplinarian that once, in accordance with his\nown severe regulations against injury to standing crops, he condemned\nhimself to death for having allowed his horse to shy into a field of\ncorn! However, in lieu of losing his head, he was persuaded to satisfy\nhis sense of justice by cutting off his hair. Ts’ao Ts’ao’s own comment\non the present passage is characteristically curt: \"when you lay down a\nlaw, see that it is not disobeyed; if it is disobeyed the offender must\nbe put to death.\"]\n\n(5) Which army is the stronger?\n\n[Morally as well as physically. As Mei Yao-ch’en puts it, freely\nrendered, \"_esprit de corps_ and ‘big battalions.’\"]\n\n(6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained?",
      "[Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzŭ as saying: \"Without constant practice, the\nofficers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle;\nwithout constant practice, the general will be wavering and irresolute\nwhen the crisis is at hand.\"]\n\n(7) In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and\npunishment?\n\n[On which side is there the most absolute certainty that merit will be\nproperly rewarded and misdeeds summarily punished?]\n\n14. By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or\ndefeat.\n\n15. The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will\nconquer:—let such a one be retained in command! The general that\nhearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat:—let\nsuch a one be dismissed!\n\n[The form of this paragraph reminds us that Sun Tzŭ’s treatise was\ncomposed expressly for the benefit of his patron Ho Lu, king of the Wu\nState.]\n\n16. While heeding the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any\nhelpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.\n\n17. According as circumstances are favourable, one should modify one’s\nplans.",
      "[Sun Tzŭ, as a practical soldier, will have none of the \"bookish\ntheoric.\" He cautions us here not to pin our faith to abstract\nprinciples; \"for,\" as Chang Yu puts it, \"while the main laws of\nstrategy can be stated clearly enough for the benefit of all and\nsundry, you must be guided by the actions of the enemy in attempting to\nsecure a favourable position in actual warfare.\" On the eve of the\nbattle of Waterloo, Lord Uxbridge, commanding the cavalry, went to the\nDuke of Wellington in order to learn what his plans and calculations\nwere for the morrow, because, as he explained, he might suddenly find\nhimself Commander-in-chief and would be unable to frame new plans in a\ncritical moment. The Duke listened quietly and then said: \"Who will\nattack the first tomorrow—I or Bonaparte?\" \"Bonaparte,\" replied Lord\nUxbridge. \"Well,\" continued the Duke, \"Bonaparte has not given me any\nidea of his projects; and as my plans will depend upon his, how can you\nexpect me to tell you what mine are?\" [1] ]\n\n18. All warfare is based on deception.\n\n[The truth of this pithy and profound saying will be admitted by every\nsoldier. Col. Henderson tells us that Wellington, great in so many\nmilitary qualities, was especially distinguished by \"the extraordinary\nskill with which he concealed his movements and deceived both friend\nand foe.\"]",
      "19. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our\nforces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy\nbelieve we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are\nnear.\n\n20. Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.\n\n[All commentators, except Chang Yu, say, \"When he is in disorder, crush\nhim.\" It is more natural to suppose that Sun Tzŭ is still illustrating\nthe uses of deception in war.]\n\n21. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in\nsuperior strength, evade him.\n\n22. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him.\nPretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.\n\n[Wang Tzŭ, quoted by Tu Yu, says that the good tactician plays with his\nadversary as a cat plays with a mouse, first feigning weakness and\nimmobility, and then suddenly pouncing upon him.]\n\n23. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest.\n\n[This is probably the meaning though Mei Yao-ch’en has the note: \"while\nwe are taking our ease, wait for the enemy to tire himself out.\" The\n_Yu Lan_ has \"Lure him on and tire him out.\"]\n\nIf his forces are united, separate them.\n\n[Less plausible is the interpretation favoured by most of the\ncommentators: \"If sovereign and subject are in accord, put division\nbetween them.\"]\n\n24. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not\nexpected.",
      "25. These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged\nbeforehand.\n\n26. Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his\ntemple ere the battle is fought.\n\n[Chang Yu tells us that in ancient times it was customary for a temple\nto be set apart for the use of a general who was about to take the\nfield, in order that he might there elaborate his plan of campaign.]\n\nThe general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand.\nThus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to\ndefeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this\npoint that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.\n\n[1] \"Words on Wellington,\" by Sir. W. Fraser.\n\nChapter II. WAGING WAR\n\n[Ts’ao Kung has the note: \"He who wishes to fight must first count the\ncost,\" which prepares us for the discovery that the subject of the\nchapter is not what we might expect from the title, but is primarily a\nconsideration of ways and means.]\n\n1. Sun Tzŭ said: In the operations of war, where there are in the field\na thousand swift chariots, as many heavy chariots, and a hundred\nthousand mail-clad soldiers,",
      "[The \"swift chariots\" were lightly built and, according to Chang Yu,\nused for the attack; the \"heavy chariots\" were heavier, and designed\nfor purposes of defence. Li Ch’uan, it is true, says that the latter\nwere light, but this seems hardly probable. It is interesting to note\nthe analogies between early Chinese warfare and that of the Homeric\nGreeks. In each case, the war-chariot was the important factor, forming\nas it did the nucleus round which was grouped a certain number of\nfoot-soldiers. With regard to the numbers given here, we are informed\nthat each swift chariot was accompanied by 75 footmen, and each heavy\nchariot by 25 footmen, so that the whole army would be divided up into\na thousand battalions, each consisting of two chariots and a hundred\nmen.]\n\nwith provisions enough to carry them a thousand _li_,\n\n[2.78 modern _li_ go to a mile. The length may have varied slightly\nsince Sun Tzŭ’s time.]\n\nthe expenditure at home and at the front, including entertainment of\nguests, small items such as glue and paint, and sums spent on chariots\nand armour, will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per\nday. Such is the cost of raising an army of 100,000 men.\n\n2. When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming,\nthe men’s weapons will grow dull and their ardour will be damped. If\nyou lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.",
      "3. Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State\nwill not be equal to the strain.\n\n4. Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardour damped, your strength\nexhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to\ntake advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be\nable to avert the consequences that must ensue.\n\n5. Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has\nnever been seen associated with long delays.",
      "[This concise and difficult sentence is not well explained by any of\nthe commentators. Ts’ao Kung, Li Ch’uan, Meng Shih, Tu Yu, Tu Mu and\nMei Yao-ch’en have notes to the effect that a general, though naturally\nstupid, may nevertheless conquer through sheer force of rapidity. Ho\nShih says: \"Haste may be stupid, but at any rate it saves expenditure\nof energy and treasure; protracted operations may be very clever, but\nthey bring calamity in their train.\" Wang Hsi evades the difficulty by\nremarking: \"Lengthy operations mean an army growing old, wealth being\nexpended, an empty exchequer and distress among the people; true\ncleverness insures against the occurrence of such calamities.\" Chang Yu\nsays: \"So long as victory can be attained, stupid haste is preferable\nto clever dilatoriness.\" Now Sun Tzŭ says nothing whatever, except\npossibly by implication, about ill-considered haste being better than\ningenious but lengthy operations. What he does say is something much\nmore guarded, namely that, while speed may sometimes be injudicious,\ntardiness can never be anything but foolish—if only because it means\nimpoverishment to the nation. In considering the point raised here by\nSun Tzŭ, the classic example of Fabius Cunctator will inevitably occur\nto the mind. That general deliberately measured the endurance of Rome\nagainst that of Hannibals’s isolated army, because it seemed to him\nthat the latter was more likely to suffer from a long campaign in a\nstrange country. But it is quite a moot question whether his tactics\nwould have proved successful in the long run. Their reversal it is\ntrue, led to Cannae; but this only establishes a negative presumption\nin their favour.]",
      "6. There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged\nwarfare.\n\n7. It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war\nthat can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on.\n\n[That is, with rapidity. Only one who knows the disastrous effects of a\nlong war can realize the supreme importance of rapidity in bringing it\nto a close. Only two commentators seem to favour this interpretation,\nbut it fits well into the logic of the context, whereas the rendering,\n\"He who does not know the evils of war cannot appreciate its benefits,\"\nis distinctly pointless.]\n\n8. The skilful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his\nsupply-waggons loaded more than twice.\n\n[Once war is declared, he will not waste precious time in waiting for\nreinforcements, nor will he return his army back for fresh supplies,\nbut crosses the enemy’s frontier without delay. This may seem an\naudacious policy to recommend, but with all great strategists, from\nJulius Caesar to Napoleon Bonaparte, the value of time—that is, being a\nlittle ahead of your opponent—has counted for more than either\nnumerical superiority or the nicest calculations with regard to\ncommissariat.]\n\n9. Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy. Thus\nthe army will have food enough for its needs.",
      "[The Chinese word translated here as \"war material\" literally means\n\"things to be used\", and is meant in the widest sense. It includes all\nthe impedimenta of an army, apart from provisions.]\n\n10. Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army to be maintained by\ncontributions from a distance. Contributing to maintain an army at a\ndistance causes the people to be impoverished.\n\n[The beginning of this sentence does not balance properly with the\nnext, though obviously intended to do so. The arrangement, moreover, is\nso awkward that I cannot help suspecting some corruption in the text.\nIt never seems to occur to Chinese commentators that an emendation may\nbe necessary for the sense, and we get no help from them there. The\nChinese words Sun Tzŭ used to indicate the cause of the people’s\nimpoverishment clearly have reference to some system by which the\nhusbandmen sent their contributions of corn to the army direct. But why\nshould it fall on them to maintain an army in this way, except because\nthe State or Government is too poor to do so?]\n\n11. On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices to go up;\nand high prices cause the people’s substance to be drained away.\n\n[Wang Hsi says high prices occur before the army has left its own\nterritory. Ts’ao Kung understands it of an army that has already\ncrossed the frontier.]",
      "12. When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be\nafflicted by heavy exactions.\n\n13, 14. With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the\nhomes of the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their\nincomes will be dissipated;\n\n[Tu Mu and Wang Hsi agree that the people are not mulcted not of 3/10,\nbut of 7/10, of their income. But this is hardly to be extracted from\nour text. Ho Shih has a characteristic tag: \"The _people_ being\nregarded as the essential part of the State, and _food_ as the people’s\nheaven, is it not right that those in authority should value and be\ncareful of both?\"]\n\nwhile Government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses,\nbreast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields,\nprotective mantlets, draught-oxen and heavy waggons, will amount to\nfour-tenths of its total revenue.\n\n15. Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One\ncartload of the enemy’s provisions is equivalent to twenty of one’s\nown, and likewise a single _picul_ of his provender is equivalent to\ntwenty from one’s own store.\n\n[Because twenty cartloads will be consumed in the process of\ntransporting one cartload to the front. A _picul_ is a unit of measure\nequal to 133.3 pounds (65.5 kilograms).]",
      "16. Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger;\nthat there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have\ntheir rewards.\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"Rewards are necessary in order to make the soldiers see\nthe advantage of beating the enemy; thus, when you capture spoils from\nthe enemy, they must be used as rewards, so that all your men may have\na keen desire to fight, each on his own account.\"]\n\n17. Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been\ntaken, those should be rewarded who took the first. Our own flags\nshould be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled\nand used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be\nkindly treated and kept.\n\n18. This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one’s own\nstrength.\n\n19. In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy\ncampaigns.\n\n[As Ho Shih remarks: \"War is not a thing to be trifled with.\" Sun Tzŭ\nhere reiterates the main lesson which this chapter is intended to\nenforce.\"]\n\n20. Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of\nthe people’s fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall\nbe in peace or in peril.\n\nChapter III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM",
      "1. Sun Tzŭ said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is\nto take the enemy’s country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it\nis not so good. So, too, it is better to capture an army entire than\nto destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire\nthan to destroy them.\n\n[The equivalent to an army corps, according to Ssu-ma Fa, consisted\nnominally of 12500 men; according to Ts’ao Kung, the equivalent of a\nregiment contained 500 men, the equivalent to a detachment consists\nfrom any number between 100 and 500, and the equivalent of a company\ncontains from 5 to 100 men. For the last two, however, Chang Yu gives\nthe exact figures of 100 and 5 respectively.]\n\n2. Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme\nexcellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s\nresistance without fighting.\n\n[Here again, no modern strategist but will approve the words of the old\nChinese general. Moltke’s greatest triumph, the capitulation of the\nhuge French army at Sedan, was won practically without bloodshed.]\n\n3. Thus the highest form of generalship is to baulk the enemy’s plans;",
      "[Perhaps the word \"balk\" falls short of expressing the full force of\nthe Chinese word, which implies not an attitude of defence, whereby one\nmight be content to foil the enemy’s stratagems one after another, but\nan active policy of counter-attack. Ho Shih puts this very clearly in\nhis note: \"When the enemy has made a plan of attack against us, we must\nanticipate him by delivering our own attack first.\"]\n\nthe next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy’s forces;\n\n[Isolating him from his allies. We must not forget that Sun Tzŭ, in\nspeaking of hostilities, always has in mind the numerous states or\nprincipalities into which the China of his day was split up.]\n\nthe next in order is to attack the enemy’s army in the field;\n\n[When he is already at full strength.]\n\nand the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.\n\n4. The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be\navoided.\n\n[Another sound piece of military theory. Had the Boers acted upon it in\n1899, and refrained from dissipating their strength before Kimberley,\nMafeking, or even Ladysmith, it is more than probable that they would\nhave been masters of the situation before the British were ready\nseriously to oppose them.]\n\nThe preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements\nof war, will take up three whole months;",
      "[It is not quite clear what the Chinese word, here translated as\n\"mantlets\", described. Ts’ao Kung simply defines them as \"large\nshields,\" but we get a better idea of them from Li Ch’uan, who says\nthey were to protect the heads of those who were assaulting the city\nwalls at close quarters. This seems to suggest a sort of Roman\n_testudo_, ready made. Tu Mu says they were wheeled vehicles used in\nrepelling attacks, but this is denied by Ch’en Hao. See _supra_ II. 14.\nThe name is also applied to turrets on city walls. Of the \"movable\nshelters\" we get a fairly clear description from several commentators.\nThey were wooden missile-proof structures on four wheels, propelled\nfrom within, covered over with raw hides, and used in sieges to convey\nparties of men to and from the walls, for the purpose of filling up the\nencircling moat with earth. Tu Mu adds that they are now called \"wooden\ndonkeys.\"]\n\nand the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three\nmonths more.\n\n[These were great mounds or ramparts of earth heaped up to the level of\nthe enemy’s walls in order to discover the weak points in the defence,\nand also to destroy the fortified turrets mentioned in the preceding\nnote.]\n\n5. The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men\nto the assault like swarming ants,",
      "[This vivid simile of Ts’ao Kung is taken from the spectacle of an army\nof ants climbing a wall. The meaning is that the general, losing\npatience at the long delay, may make a premature attempt to storm the\nplace before his engines of war are ready.]\n\nwith the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town\nstill remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.\n\n[We are reminded of the terrible losses of the Japanese before Port\nArthur, in the most recent siege which history has to record.]\n\n6. Therefore the skilful leader subdues the enemy’s troops without any\nfighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he\noverthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.\n\n[Chia Lin notes that he only overthrows the Government, but does no\nharm to individuals. The classical instance is Wu Wang, who after\nhaving put an end to the Yin dynasty was acclaimed \"Father and mother\nof the people.\"]\n\n7. With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire,\nand thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete.\n\n[Owing to the double meanings in the Chinese text, the latter part of\nthe sentence is susceptible of quite a different meaning: \"And thus,\nthe weapon not being blunted by use, its keenness remains perfect.\"]\n\nThis is the method of attacking by stratagem.",
      "8. It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy’s one, to\nsurround him; if five to one, to attack him;\n\n[Straightway, without waiting for any further advantage.]\n\nif twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.\n\n[Tu Mu takes exception to the saying; and at first sight, indeed, it\nappears to violate a fundamental principle of war. Ts’ao Kung, however,\ngives a clue to Sun Tzŭ’s meaning: \"Being two to the enemy’s one, we\nmay use one part of our army in the regular way, and the other for some\nspecial diversion.\" Chang Yu thus further elucidates the point: \"If our\nforce is twice as numerous as that of the enemy, it should be split up\ninto two divisions, one to meet the enemy in front, and one to fall\nupon his rear; if he replies to the frontal attack, he may be crushed\nfrom behind; if to the rearward attack, he may be crushed in front.\"\nThis is what is meant by saying that ‘one part may be used in the\nregular way, and the other for some special diversion.’ Tu Mu does not\nunderstand that dividing one’s army is simply an irregular, just as\nconcentrating it is the regular, strategical method, and he is too\nhasty in calling this a mistake.\"]\n\n9. If equally matched, we can offer battle;\n\n[Li Ch’uan, followed by Ho Shih, gives the following paraphrase: \"If\nattackers and attacked are equally matched in strength, only the able\ngeneral will fight.\"]",
      "if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy;\n\n[The meaning, \"we can _watch_ the enemy,\" is certainly a great\nimprovement on the above; but unfortunately there appears to be no very\ngood authority for the variant. Chang Yu reminds us that the saying\nonly applies if the other factors are equal; a small difference in\nnumbers is often more than counterbalanced by superior energy and\ndiscipline.]\n\nif quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.\n\n10. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in\nthe end it must be captured by the larger force.\n\n11. Now the general is the bulwark of the State: if the bulwark is\ncomplete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is\ndefective, the State will be weak.\n\n[As Li Ch’uan tersely puts it: \"Gap indicates deficiency; if the\ngeneral’s ability is not perfect (i.e. if he is not thoroughly versed\nin his profession), his army will lack strength.\"]\n\n12. There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his\narmy:—\n\n13. (1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant\nof the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army.",
      "[Li Ch’uan adds the comment: \"It is like tying together the legs of a\nthoroughbred, so that it is unable to gallop.\" One would naturally\nthink of \"the ruler\" in this passage as being at home, and trying to\ndirect the movements of his army from a distance. But the commentators\nunderstand just the reverse, and quote the saying of T’ai Kung: \"A\nkingdom should not be governed from without, and army should not be\ndirected from within.\" Of course it is true that, during an engagement,\nor when in close touch with the enemy, the general should not be in the\nthick of his own troops, but a little distance apart. Otherwise, he\nwill be liable to misjudge the position as a whole, and give wrong\norders.]\n\n14. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he\nadministers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in\nan army. This causes restlessness in the soldier’s minds.\n\n[Ts’ao Kung’s note is, freely translated: \"The military sphere and the\ncivil sphere are wholly distinct; you can’t handle an army in kid\ngloves.\" And Chang Yu says: \"Humanity and justice are the principles on\nwhich to govern a state, but not an army; opportunism and flexibility,\non the other hand, are military rather than civil virtues to assimilate\nthe governing of an army\"—to that of a State, understood.]\n\n15. (3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination,",
      "[That is, he is not careful to use the right man in the right place.]\n\nthrough ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to\ncircumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.\n\n[I follow Mei Yao-ch’en here. The other commentators refer not to the\nruler, as in §§ 13, 14, but to the officers he employs. Thus Tu Yu\nsays: \"If a general is ignorant of the principle of adaptability, he\nmust not be entrusted with a position of authority.\" Tu Mu quotes: \"The\nskilful employer of men will employ the wise man, the brave man, the\ncovetous man, and the stupid man. For the wise man delights in\nestablishing his merit, the brave man likes to show his courage in\naction, the covetous man is quick at seizing advantages, and the stupid\nman has no fear of death.\"]\n\n16. But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to\ncome from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy\ninto the army, and flinging victory away.\n\n17. Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: (1) He\nwill win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.\n\n[Chang Yu says: If he can fight, he advances and takes the offensive;\nif he cannot fight, he retreats and remains on the defensive. He will\ninvariably conquer who knows whether it is right to take the offensive\nor the defensive.]\n\n(2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior\nforces.",
      "[This is not merely the general’s ability to estimate numbers\ncorrectly, as Li Ch’uan and others make out. Chang Yu expounds the\nsaying more satisfactorily: \"By applying the art of war, it is possible\nwith a lesser force to defeat a greater, and _vice versa_. The secret\nlies in an eye for locality, and in not letting the right moment slip.\nThus Wu Tzŭ says: ‘With a superior force, make for easy ground; with an\ninferior one, make for difficult ground.’\"]\n\n(3) He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout\nall its ranks.\n\n(4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy\nunprepared.\n\n(5) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by\nthe sovereign.\n\n[Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzŭ as saying: \"It is the sovereign’s function to\ngive broad instructions, but to decide on battle it is the function of\nthe general.\" It is needless to dilate on the military disasters which\nhave been caused by undue interference with operations in the field on\nthe part of the home government. Napoleon undoubtedly owed much of his\nextraordinary success to the fact that he was not hampered by central\nauthority.]\n\nVictory lies in the knowledge of these five points.\n\n[Literally, “These five things are knowledge of the principle of\nvictory.”]",
      "18. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need\nnot fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not\nthe enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat.\n\n[Li Ch’uan cites the case of Fu Chien, prince of Ch’in, who in 383 A.D.\nmarched with a vast army against the Chin Emperor. When warned not to\ndespise an enemy who could command the services of such men as Hsieh An\nand Huan Ch’ung, he boastfully replied: \"I have the population of eight\nprovinces at my back, infantry and horsemen to the number of one\nmillion; why, they could dam up the Yangtsze River itself by merely\nthrowing their whips into the stream. What danger have I to fear?\"\nNevertheless, his forces were soon after disastrously routed at the Fei\nRiver, and he was obliged to beat a hasty retreat.]\n\nIf you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every\nbattle.\n\n[Chang Yu said: \"Knowing the enemy enables you to take the offensive,\nknowing yourself enables you to stand on the defensive.\" He adds:\n\"Attack is the secret of defence; defence is the planning of an\nattack.\" It would be hard to find a better epitome of the\nroot-principle of war.]\n\nChapter IV. TACTICAL DISPOSITIONS",
      "[Ts’ao Kung explains the Chinese meaning of the words for the title of\nthis chapter: \"marching and countermarching on the part of the two\narmies with a view to discovering each other’s condition.\" Tu Mu says:\n\"It is through the dispositions of an army that its condition may be\ndiscovered. Conceal your dispositions, and your condition will remain\nsecret, which leads to victory; show your dispositions, and your\ncondition will become patent, which leads to defeat.\" Wang Hsi remarks\nthat the good general can \"secure success by modifying his tactics to\nmeet those of the enemy.\"]\n\n1. Sun Tzŭ said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond\nthe possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of\ndefeating the enemy.\n\n2. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the\nopportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.\n\n[That is, of course, by a mistake on the enemy’s part.]\n\n3. Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat,\n\n[Chang Yu says this is done, \"By concealing the disposition of his\ntroops, covering up his tracks, and taking unremitting precautions.\"]\n\nbut cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.\n\n4. Hence the saying: One may _know_ how to conquer without being able\nto _do_ it.\n\n5. Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat\nthe enemy means taking the offensive.",
      "[I retain the sense found in a similar passage in §§ 1-3, in spite of\nthe fact that the commentators are all against me. The meaning they\ngive, \"He who cannot conquer takes the defensive,\" is plausible\nenough.]\n\n6. Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength;\nattacking, a superabundance of strength.\n\n7. The general who is skilled in defence hides in the most secret\nrecesses of the earth;\n\n[Literally, \"hides under the ninth earth,\" which is a metaphor\nindicating the utmost secrecy and concealment, so that the enemy may\nnot know his whereabouts.\"]\n\nhe who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of\nheaven.\n\n[Another metaphor, implying that he falls on his adversary like a\nthunderbolt, against which there is no time to prepare. This is the\nopinion of most of the commentators.]\n\nThus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the\nother, a victory that is complete.\n\n8. To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is\nnot the acme of excellence.",
      "[As Ts’ao Kung remarks, \"the thing is to see the plant before it has\ngerminated,\" to foresee the event before the action has begun. Li\nCh’uan alludes to the story of Han Hsin who, when about to attack the\nvastly superior army of Chao, which was strongly entrenched in the city\nof Ch’eng-an, said to his officers: \"Gentlemen, we are going to\nannihilate the enemy, and shall meet again at dinner.\" The officers\nhardly took his words seriously, and gave a very dubious assent. But\nHan Hsin had already worked out in his mind the details of a clever\nstratagem, whereby, as he foresaw, he was able to capture the city and\ninflict a crushing defeat on his adversary.\"]\n\n9. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and\nthe whole Empire says, \"Well done!\"\n\n[True excellence being, as Tu Mu says: \"To plan secretly, to move\nsurreptitiously, to foil the enemy’s intentions and balk his schemes,\nso that at last the day may be won without shedding a drop of blood.\"\nSun Tzŭ reserves his approbation for things that\n\n\"the world’s coarse thumb\nAnd finger fail to plumb.\"\n\n10. To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength;\n\n[\"Autumn hair\" is explained as the fur of a hare, which is finest in\nautumn, when it begins to grow afresh. The phrase is a very common one\nin Chinese writers.]",
      "to see sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of\nthunder is no sign of a quick ear.\n\n[Ho Shih gives as real instances of strength, sharp sight and quick\nhearing: Wu Huo, who could lift a tripod weighing 250 stone; Li Chu,\nwho at a distance of a hundred paces could see objects no bigger than a\nmustard seed; and Shih K’uang, a blind musician who could hear the\nfootsteps of a mosquito.]\n\n11. What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins,\nbut excels in winning with ease.\n\n[The last half is literally \"one who, conquering, excels in easy\nconquering.\" Mei Yao-ch’en says: \"He who only sees the obvious, wins\nhis battles with difficulty; he who looks below the surface of things,\nwins with ease.\"]\n\n12. Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor\ncredit for courage.\n\n[Tu Mu explains this very well: \"Inasmuch as his victories are gained\nover circumstances that have not come to light, the world as large\nknows nothing of them, and he wins no reputation for wisdom; inasmuch\nas the hostile state submits before there has been any bloodshed, he\nreceives no credit for courage.\"]\n\n13. He wins his battles by making no mistakes.",
      "[Ch’en Hao says: \"He plans no superfluous marches, he devises no futile\nattacks.\" The connection of ideas is thus explained by Chang Yu: \"One\nwho seeks to conquer by sheer strength, clever though he may be at\nwinning pitched battles, is also liable on occasion to be vanquished;\nwhereas he who can look into the future and discern conditions that are\nnot yet manifest, will never make a blunder and therefore invariably\nwin.\"]\n\nMaking no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it\nmeans conquering an enemy that is already defeated.\n\n14. Hence the skilful fighter puts himself into a position which makes\ndefeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the\nenemy.\n\n[A \"counsel of perfection\" as Tu Mu truly observes. \"Position\" need not\nbe confined to the actual ground occupied by the troops. It includes\nall the arrangements and preparations which a wise general will make to\nincrease the safety of his army.]\n\n15. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle\nafter the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat\nfirst fights and afterwards looks for victory.\n\n[Ho Shih thus expounds the paradox: \"In warfare, first lay plans which\nwill ensure victory, and then lead your army to battle; if you will not\nbegin with stratagem but rely on brute strength alone, victory will no\nlonger be assured.\"]",
      "16. The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly\nadheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control\nsuccess.\n\n17. In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement;\nsecondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly,\nBalancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.\n\n18. Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to\nMeasurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of\nchances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.",
      "[It is not easy to distinguish the four terms very clearly in the\nChinese. The first seems to be surveying and measurement of the ground,\nwhich enable us to form an estimate of the enemy’s strength, and to\nmake calculations based on the data thus obtained; we are thus led to a\ngeneral weighing-up, or comparison of the enemy’s chances with our own;\nif the latter turn the scale, then victory ensues. The chief difficulty\nlies in third term, which in the Chinese some commentators take as a\ncalculation of _numbers_, thereby making it nearly synonymous with the\nsecond term. Perhaps the second term should be thought of as a\nconsideration of the enemy’s general position or condition, while the\nthird term is the estimate of his numerical strength. On the other\nhand, Tu Mu says: \"The question of relative strength having been\nsettled, we can bring the varied resources of cunning into play.\" Ho\nShih seconds this interpretation, but weakens it. However, it points to\nthe third term as being a calculation of numbers.]\n\n19. A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound’s weight\nplaced in the scale against a single grain.",
      "[Literally, \"a victorious army is like an _i_ (20 oz.) weighed against\na _shu_ (1/24 oz.); a routed army is a _shu_ weighed against an _i_.\"\nThe point is simply the enormous advantage which a disciplined force,\nflushed with victory, has over one demoralized by defeat. Legge, in his\nnote on Mencius, I. 2. ix. 2, makes the _i_ to be 24 Chinese ounces,\nand corrects Chu Hsi’s statement that it equaled 20 oz. only. But Li\nCh’uan of the T’ang dynasty here gives the same figure as Chu Hsi.]\n\n20. The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up\nwaters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep. So much for tactical\ndispositions.\n\nChapter V. ENERGY\n\n1. Sun Tzŭ said: The control of a large force is the same principle as\nthe control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their\nnumbers.\n\n[That is, cutting up the army into regiments, companies, etc., with\nsubordinate officers in command of each. Tu Mu reminds us of Han Hsin’s\nfamous reply to the first Han Emperor, who once said to him: \"How large\nan army do you think I could lead?\" \"Not more than 100,000 men, your\nMajesty.\" \"And you?\" asked the Emperor. \"Oh!\" he answered, \"the more\nthe better.\"]\n\n2. Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different\nfrom fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting\nsigns and signals.",
      "3. To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the\nenemy’s attack and remain unshaken—this is effected by manœuvers direct\nand indirect.",
      "[We now come to one of the most interesting parts of Sun Tzŭ’s\ntreatise, the discussion of the _cheng_ and the _ch’i_.\" As it is by no\nmeans easy to grasp the full significance of these two terms, or to\nrender them consistently by good English equivalents; it may be as well\nto tabulate some of the commentators’ remarks on the subject before\nproceeding further. Li Ch’uan: \"Facing the enemy is _cheng_, making\nlateral diversion is _ch’i_. Chia Lin: \"In presence of the enemy, your\ntroops should be arrayed in normal fashion, but in order to secure\nvictory abnormal manœuvers must be employed.\" Mei Yao-ch’en: \"_Ch’i_ is\nactive, _cheng_ is passive; passivity means waiting for an opportunity,\nactivity brings the victory itself.\" Ho Shih: \"We must cause the enemy\nto regard our straightforward attack as one that is secretly designed,\nand vice versa; thus _cheng_ may also be _ch’i_, and _ch’i_ may also be\n_cheng_.\" He instances the famous exploit of Han Hsin, who when\nmarching ostensibly against Lin-chin (now Chao-i in Shensi), suddenly\nthrew a large force across the Yellow River in wooden tubs, utterly\ndisconcerting his opponent. [Ch’ien Han Shu, ch. 3.] Here, we are told,\nthe march on Lin-chin was _cheng_, and the surprise manœuver was\n_ch’i_.\" Chang Yu gives the following summary of opinions on the words:\n\"Military writers do not agree with regard to the meaning of _ch’i_ and\n_cheng_. Wei Liao Tzŭ [4th cent. B.C.] says: ‘Direct warfare favours\nfrontal attacks, indirect warfare attacks from the rear.’ Ts’ao Kung\nsays: ‘Going straight out to join battle is a direct operation;\nappearing on the enemy’s rear is an indirect manœuver.’ Li Wei-kung\n[6th and 7th cent. A.D.] says: ‘In war, to march straight ahead is\n_cheng_; turning movements, on the other hand, are _ch’i_.’ These\nwriters simply regard _cheng_ as _cheng_, and _ch’i_ as _ch’i_; they do\nnot note that the two are mutually interchangeable and run into each\nother like the two sides of a circle [see infra, § 11]. A comment on\nthe T’ang Emperor T’ai Tsung goes to the root of the matter: ‘A _ch’i_\nmanœuver may be _cheng_, if we make the enemy look upon it as _cheng_;\nthen our real attack will be _ch’i_, and vice versa. The whole secret\nlies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real\nintent.’\" To put it perhaps a little more clearly: any attack or other\noperation is _cheng_, on which the enemy has had his attention fixed;\nwhereas that is _ch’i_,\" which takes him by surprise or comes from an\nunexpected quarter. If the enemy perceives a movement which is meant to\nbe _ch’i_,\" it immediately becomes _cheng_.\"]",
      "4. That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against\nan egg—this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.\n\n5. In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle,\nbut indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.\n\n[Chang Yu says: \"Steadily develop indirect tactics, either by pounding\nthe enemy’s flanks or falling on his rear.\" A brilliant example of\n\"indirect tactics\" which decided the fortunes of a campaign was Lord\nRoberts’ night march round the Peiwar Kotal in the second Afghan war.\n[1]\n\n6. Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhausible as Heaven\nand Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and\nmoon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away\nbut to return once more.\n\n[Tu Yu and Chang Yu understand this of the permutations of _ch’i_ and\n_cheng_. But at present Sun Tzŭ is not speaking of _cheng_ at all,\nunless, indeed, we suppose with Cheng Yu-hsien that a clause relating\nto it has fallen out of the text. Of course, as has already been\npointed out, the two are so inextricably interwoven in all military\noperations, that they cannot really be considered apart. Here we simply\nhave an expression, in figurative language, of the almost infinite\nresource of a great leader.]",
      "7. There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of\nthese five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.\n\n8. There are not more than five primary colours (blue, yellow, red,\nwhite, and black), yet in combination they produce more hues than can\never be seen.\n\n9 There are not more than five cardinal tastes (sour, acrid, salt,\nsweet, bitter), yet combinations of them yield more flavours than can\never be tasted.\n\n10. In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack—the direct\nand the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless\nseries of manœuvers.\n\n11. The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is\nlike moving in a circle—you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the\npossibilities of their combination?\n\n12. The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even\nroll stones along in its course.\n\n13. The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon\nwhich enables it to strike and destroy its victim.",
      "[The Chinese here is tricky and a certain key word in the context it is\nused defies the best efforts of the translator. Tu Mu defines this word\nas \"the measurement or estimation of distance.\" But this meaning does\nnot quite fit the illustrative simile in §. 15. Applying this\ndefinition to the falcon, it seems to me to denote that instinct of\n_self-restraint_ which keeps the bird from swooping on its quarry until\nthe right moment, together with the power of judging when the right\nmoment has arrived. The analogous quality in soldiers is the highly\nimportant one of being able to reserve their fire until the very\ninstant at which it will be most effective. When the \"Victory\" went\ninto action at Trafalgar at hardly more than drifting pace, she was for\nseveral minutes exposed to a storm of shot and shell before replying\nwith a single gun. Nelson coolly waited until he was within close\nrange, when the broadside he brought to bear worked fearful havoc on\nthe enemy’s nearest ships.]\n\n14. Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and\nprompt in his decision.",
      "[The word \"decision\" would have reference to the measurement of\ndistance mentioned above, letting the enemy get near before striking.\nBut I cannot help thinking that Sun Tzŭ meant to use the word in a\nfigurative sense comparable to our own idiom \"short and sharp.\" Cf.\nWang Hsi’s note, which after describing the falcon’s mode of attack,\nproceeds: \"This is just how the ‘psychological moment’ should be seized\nin war.\"]\n\n15. Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to\nthe releasing of the trigger.\n\n[None of the commentators seem to grasp the real point of the simile of\nenergy and the force stored up in the bent cross-bow until released by\nthe finger on the trigger.]\n\n16. Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming\ndisorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos,\nyour array may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against\ndefeat.\n\n[Mei Yao-ch’en says: \"The subdivisions of the army having been\npreviously fixed, and the various signals agreed upon, the separating\nand joining, the dispersing and collecting which will take place in the\ncourse of a battle, may give the appearance of disorder when no real\ndisorder is possible. Your formation may be without head or tail, your\ndispositions all topsy-turvy, and yet a rout of your forces quite out\nof the question.\"]",
      "17. Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline; simulated fear\npostulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength.\n\n[In order to make the translation intelligible, it is necessary to tone\ndown the sharply paradoxical form of the original. Ts’ao Kung throws\nout a hint of the meaning in his brief note: \"These things all serve to\ndestroy formation and conceal one’s condition.\" But Tu Mu is the first\nto put it quite plainly: \"If you wish to feign confusion in order to\nlure the enemy on, you must first have perfect discipline; if you wish\nto display timidity in order to entrap the enemy, you must have extreme\ncourage; if you wish to parade your weakness in order to make the enemy\nover-confident, you must have exceeding strength.\"]\n\n18. Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of\nsubdivision;\n\n[See _supra_, § 1.]\n\nconcealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of\nlatent energy;\n\n[The commentators strongly understand a certain Chinese word here\ndifferently than anywhere else in this chapter. Thus Tu Mu says:\n\"seeing that we are favourably circumstanced and yet make no move, the\nenemy will believe that we are really afraid.\"]\n\nmasking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical\ndispositions.",
      "[Chang Yu relates the following anecdote of Kao Tsu, the first Han\nEmperor: “Wishing to crush the Hsiung-nu, he sent out spies to report\non their condition. But the Hsiung-nu, forewarned, carefully concealed\nall their able-bodied men and well-fed horses, and only allowed infirm\nsoldiers and emaciated cattle to be seen. The result was that spies one\nand all recommended the Emperor to deliver his attack. Lou Ching alone\nopposed them, saying: ‘When two countries go to war, they are naturally\ninclined to make an ostentatious display of their strength. Yet our\nspies have seen nothing but old age and infirmity. This is surely some\n_ruse_ on the part of the enemy, and it would be unwise for us to\nattack.’ The Emperor, however, disregarding this advice, fell into the\ntrap and found himself surrounded at Po-teng.”]\n\n19. Thus one who is skilful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains\ndeceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act.",
      "[Ts’ao Kung’s note is \"Make a display of weakness and want.\" Tu Mu\nsays: \"If our force happens to be superior to the enemy’s, weakness may\nbe simulated in order to lure him on; but if inferior, he must be led\nto believe that we are strong, in order that he may keep off. In fact,\nall the enemy’s movements should be determined by the signs that we\nchoose to give him.\" Note the following anecdote of Sun Pin, a\ndescendent of Sun Wu: In 341 B.C., the Ch’i State being at war with\nWei, sent T’ien Chi and Sun Pin against the general P’ang Chuan, who\nhappened to be a deadly personal enemy of the later. Sun Pin said: \"The\nCh’i State has a reputation for cowardice, and therefore our adversary\ndespises us. Let us turn this circumstance to account.\" Accordingly,\nwhen the army had crossed the border into Wei territory, he gave orders\nto show 100,000 fires on the first night, 50,000 on the next, and the\nnight after only 20,000. P’ang Chuan pursued them hotly, saying to\nhimself: \"I knew these men of Ch’i were cowards: their numbers have\nalready fallen away by more than half.\" In his retreat, Sun Pin came to\na narrow defile, which he calculated that his pursuers would reach\nafter dark. Here he had a tree stripped of its bark, and inscribed upon\nit the words: \"Under this tree shall P’ang Chuan die.\" Then, as night\nbegan to fall, he placed a strong body of archers in ambush near by,\nwith orders to shoot directly if they saw a light. Later on, P’ang\nChuan arrived at the spot, and noticing the tree, struck a light in\norder to read what was written on it. His body was immediately riddled\nby a volley of arrows, and his whole army thrown into confusion. [The\nabove is Tu Mu’s version of the story; the _Shih Chi_, less\ndramatically but probably with more historical truth, makes P’ang Chuan\ncut his own throat with an exclamation of despair, after the rout of\nhis army.] ]",
      "He sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it.\n\n20. By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a body\nof picked men he lies in wait for him.\n\n[With an emendation suggested by Li Ching, this then reads, \"He lies in\nwait with the main body of his troops.\"]\n\n21. The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and\ndoes not require too much from individuals.\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"He first of all considers the power of his army in the\nbulk; afterwards he takes individual talent into account, and uses each\nmen according to his capabilities. He does not demand perfection from\nthe untalented.\"]\n\nHence his ability to pick out the right men and utilise combined\nenergy.\n\n22. When he utilises combined energy, his fighting men become as it\nwere like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or\nstone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a\nslope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped,\nto go rolling down.\n\n[Ts’au Kung calls this \"the use of natural or inherent power.\"]\n\n23. Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum\nof a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. So\nmuch on the subject of energy.",
      "[The chief lesson of this chapter, in Tu Mu’s opinion, is the paramount\nimportance in war of rapid evolutions and sudden rushes. \"Great\nresults,\" he adds, \"can thus be achieved with small forces.\"]\n\n[1] \"Forty-one Years in India,\" chapter 46.\n\nChapter VI. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG\n\n[Chang Yu attempts to explain the sequence of chapters as follows:\n\"Chapter IV, on Tactical Dispositions, treated of the offensive and the\ndefensive; chapter V, on Energy, dealt with direct and indirect\nmethods. The good general acquaints himself first with the theory of\nattack and defence, and then turns his attention to direct and indirect\nmethods. He studies the art of varying and combining these two methods\nbefore proceeding to the subject of weak and strong points. For the use\nof direct or indirect methods arises out of attack and defence, and the\nperception of weak and strong points depends again on the above\nmethods. Hence the present chapter comes immediately after the chapter\non Energy.\"]\n\n1. Sun Tzŭ said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of\nthe enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field\nand has to hasten to battle, will arrive exhausted.\n\n2. Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but\ndoes not allow the enemy’s will to be imposed on him.\n\n[One mark of a great soldier is that he fight on his own terms or\nfights not at all. [1] ]",
      "3. By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach\nof his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible\nfor the enemy to draw near.\n\n[In the first case, he will entice him with a bait; in the second, he\nwill strike at some important point which the enemy will have to\ndefend.]\n\n4. If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him;\n\n[This passage may be cited as evidence against Mei Yao- Ch’en’s\ninterpretation of I. § 23.]\n\nif well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped,\nhe can force him to move.\n\n5. Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march\nswiftly to places where you are not expected.\n\n6. An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches\nthrough country where the enemy is not.\n\n[Ts’ao Kung sums up very well: \"Emerge from the void [q.d. like \"a bolt\nfrom the blue\"], strike at vulnerable points, shun places that are\ndefended, attack in unexpected quarters.\"]\n\n7. You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack\nplaces which are undefended.\n\n[Wang Hsi explains \"undefended places\" as \"weak points; that is to say,\nwhere the general is lacking in capacity, or the soldiers in spirit;\nwhere the walls are not strong enough, or the precautions not strict\nenough; where relief comes too late, or provisions are too scanty, or\nthe defenders are variance amongst themselves.\"]",
      "You can ensure the safety of your defence if you only hold positions\nthat cannot be attacked.\n\n[_I.e._, where there are none of the weak points mentioned above. There\nis rather a nice point involved in the interpretation of this later\nclause. Tu Mu, Ch’en Hao, and Mei Yao-ch’en assume the meaning to be:\n\"In order to make your defence quite safe, you must defend _even_ those\nplaces that are not likely to be attacked;\" and Tu Mu adds: \"How much\nmore, then, those that will be attacked.\" Taken thus, however, the\nclause balances less well with the preceding—always a consideration in\nthe highly antithetical style which is natural to the Chinese. Chang\nYu, therefore, seems to come nearer the mark in saying: \"He who is\nskilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven [see\nIV. § 7], making it impossible for the enemy to guard against him. This\nbeing so, the places that I shall attack are precisely those that the\nenemy cannot defend…. He who is skilled in defence hides in the most\nsecret recesses of the earth, making it impossible for the enemy to\nestimate his whereabouts. This being so, the places that I shall hold\nare precisely those that the enemy cannot attack.\"]\n\n8. Hence that general is skilful in attack whose opponent does not\nknow what to defend; and he is skilful in defence whose opponent does\nnot know what to attack.",
      "[An aphorism which puts the whole art of war in a nutshell.]\n\n9. O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be\ninvisible, through you inaudible;\n\n[Literally, \"without form or sound,\" but it is said of course with\nreference to the enemy.]\n\nand hence we can hold the enemy’s fate in our hands.\n\n10. You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the\nenemy’s weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your\nmovements are more rapid than those of the enemy.\n\n11. If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even\nthough he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we\nneed do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"If the enemy is the invading party, we can cut his line\nof communications and occupy the roads by which he will have to return;\nif we are the invaders, we may direct our attack against the sovereign\nhimself.\" It is clear that Sun Tzŭ, unlike certain generals in the late\nBoer war, was no believer in frontal attacks.]\n\n12. If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging\nus even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the\nground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in\nhis way.",
      "[This extremely concise expression is intelligibly paraphrased by Chia\nLin: \"even though we have constructed neither wall nor ditch.\" Li\nCh’uan says: \"we puzzle him by strange and unusual dispositions;\" and\nTu Mu finally clinches the meaning by three illustrative anecdotes—one\nof Chu-ko Liang, who when occupying Yang-p’ing and about to be attacked\nby Ssu-ma I, suddenly struck his colors, stopped the beating of the\ndrums, and flung open the city gates, showing only a few men engaged in\nsweeping and sprinkling the ground. This unexpected proceeding had the\nintended effect; for Ssu-ma I, suspecting an ambush, actually drew off\nhis army and retreated. What Sun Tzŭ is advocating here, therefore, is\nnothing more nor less than the timely use of \"bluff.\"]\n\n13. By discovering the enemy’s dispositions and remaining invisible\nourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy’s must\nbe divided.\n\n[The conclusion is perhaps not very obvious, but Chang Yu (after Mei\nYao-ch’en) rightly explains it thus: \"If the enemy’s dispositions are\nvisible, we can make for him in one body; whereas, our own dispositions\nbeing kept secret, the enemy will be obliged to divide his forces in\norder to guard against attack from every quarter.\"]",
      "14. We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up\ninto fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate\nparts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy’s few.\n\n15. And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior\none, our opponents will be in dire straits.\n\n16. The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then\nthe enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several\ndifferent points;\n\n[Sheridan once explained the reason of General Grant’s victories by\nsaying that \"while his opponents were kept fully employed wondering\nwhat he was going to do, _he_ was thinking most of what he was going to\ndo himself.\"]\n\nand his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers\nwe shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.\n\n17. For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear;\nshould he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he\nstrengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his\nright, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere,\nhe will everywhere be weak.",
      "[In Frederick the Great’s _Instructions to his Generals_ we read: \"A\ndefensive war is apt to betray us into too frequent detachment. Those\ngenerals who have had but little experience attempt to protect every\npoint, while those who are better acquainted with their profession,\nhaving only the capital object in view, guard against a decisive blow,\nand acquiesce in small misfortunes to avoid greater.\"]\n\n18. Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible\nattacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make\nthese preparations against us.\n\n[The highest generalship, in Col. Henderson’s words, is \"to compel the\nenemy to disperse his army, and then to concentrate superior force\nagainst each fraction in turn.\"]\n\n19. Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may\nconcentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.\n\n[What Sun Tzŭ evidently has in mind is that nice calculation of\ndistances and that masterly employment of strategy which enable a\ngeneral to divide his army for the purpose of a long and rapid march,\nand afterwards to effect a junction at precisely the right spot and the\nright hour in order to confront the enemy in overwhelming strength.\nAmong many such successful junctions which military history records,\none of the most dramatic and decisive was the appearance of Blucher\njust at the critical moment on the field of Waterloo.]",
      "20. But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be\nimpotent to succour the right, the right equally impotent to succour the\nleft, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the\nvan. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything\nunder a hundred _li_ apart, and even the nearest are separated by\nseveral _li_!\n\n[The Chinese of this last sentence is a little lacking in precision,\nbut the mental picture we are required to draw is probably that of an\narmy advancing towards a given rendezvous in separate columns, each of\nwhich has orders to be there on a fixed date. If the general allows the\nvarious detachments to proceed at haphazard, without precise\ninstructions as to the time and place of meeting, the enemy will be\nable to annihilate the army in detail. Chang Yu’s note may be worth\nquoting here: \"If we do not know the place where our opponents mean to\nconcentrate or the day on which they will join battle, our unity will\nbe forfeited through our preparations for defence, and the positions we\nhold will be insecure. Suddenly happening upon a powerful foe, we shall\nbe brought to battle in a flurried condition, and no mutual support\nwill be possible between wings, vanguard or rear, especially if there\nis any great distance between the foremost and hindmost divisions of\nthe army.\"]",
      "21. Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yüeh exceed our own\nin number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory.\nI say then that victory can be achieved.\n\n[Alas for these brave words! The long feud between the two states ended\nin 473 B.C. with the total defeat of Wu by Kou Chien and its\nincorporation in Yüeh. This was doubtless long after Sun Tzŭ’s death.\nWith his present assertion compare IV. § 4. Chang Yu is the only one to\npoint out the seeming discrepancy, which he thus goes on to explain:\n\"In the chapter on Tactical Dispositions it is said, ‘One may _know_\nhow to conquer without being able to _do_ it,’ whereas here we have the\nstatement that ‘victory’ can be achieved.’ The explanation is, that in\nthe former chapter, where the offensive and defensive are under\ndiscussion, it is said that if the enemy is fully prepared, one cannot\nmake certain of beating him. But the present passage refers\nparticularly to the soldiers of Yüeh who, according to Sun Tzŭ’s\ncalculations, will be kept in ignorance of the time and place of the\nimpending struggle. That is why he says here that victory can be\nachieved.\"]\n\n22. Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from\nfighting. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of\ntheir success.",
      "[An alternative reading offered by Chia Lin is: \"Know beforehand all\nplans conducive to our success and to the enemy’s failure.\"\n\n23. Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity.\n\n[Chang Yu tells us that by noting the joy or anger shown by the enemy\non being thus disturbed, we shall be able to conclude whether his\npolicy is to lie low or the reverse. He instances the action of Cho-ku\nLiang, who sent the scornful present of a woman’s head-dress to Ssu-ma\nI, in order to goad him out of his Fabian tactics.]\n\nForce him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots.\n\n24. Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may\nknow where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient.\n\n[Cf. IV. § 6.]\n\n25. In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain\nis to conceal them;\n\n[The piquancy of the paradox evaporates in translation. Concealment is\nperhaps not so much actual invisibility (see _supra_ § 9) as \"showing\nno sign\" of what you mean to do, of the plans that are formed in your\nbrain.]\n\nconceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from the prying of the\nsubtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains.\n\n[Tu Mu explains: \"Though the enemy may have clever and capable\nofficers, they will not be able to lay any plans against us.\"]",
      "26. How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy’s own\ntactics—that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.\n\n27. All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can\nsee is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.\n\n[_I.e._, everybody can see superficially how a battle is won; what they\ncannot see is the long series of plans and combinations which has\npreceded the battle.]\n\n28. Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but\nlet your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.\n\n[As Wang Hsi sagely remarks: \"There is but one root-principle\nunderlying victory, but the tactics which lead up to it are infinite in\nnumber.\" With this compare Col. Henderson: \"The rules of strategy are\nfew and simple. They may be learned in a week. They may be taught by\nfamiliar illustrations or a dozen diagrams. But such knowledge will no\nmore teach a man to lead an army like Napoleon than a knowledge of\ngrammar will teach him to write like Gibbon.\"]\n\n29. Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural\ncourse runs away from high places and hastens downwards.\n\n30. So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what\nis weak.\n\n[Like water, taking the line of least resistance.]",
      "31. Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over\nwhich it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the\nfoe whom he is facing.\n\n32. Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare\nthere are no constant conditions.\n\n33. He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and\nthereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain.\n\n34. The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth) are not always\nequally predominant;\n\n[That is, as Wang Hsi says: \"they predominate alternately.\"]\n\nthe four seasons make way for each other in turn.\n\n[Literally, \"have no invariable seat.\"]\n\nThere are short days and long; the moon has its periods of waning and\nwaxing.\n\n[Cf. V. § 6. The purport of the passage is simply to illustrate the\nwant of fixity in war by the changes constantly taking place in Nature.\nThe comparison is not very happy, however, because the regularity of\nthe phenomena which Sun Tzŭ mentions is by no means paralleled in war.]\n\n[1] See Col. Henderson’s biography of Stonewall Jackson, 1902 ed., vol.\nII, p. 490.\n\nChapter VII. MANŒUVERING\n\n1. Sun Tzŭ said: In war, the general receives his commands from the\nsovereign.\n\n2. Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must blend\nand harmonise the different elements thereof before pitching his camp.",
      "[\"Chang Yu says: \"the establishment of harmony and confidence between\nthe higher and lower ranks before venturing into the field;\" and he\nquotes a saying of Wu Tzŭ (chap. 1 ad init.): \"Without harmony in the\nState, no military expedition can be undertaken; without harmony in the\narmy, no battle array can be formed.\" In an historical romance Sun Tzŭ\nis represented as saying to Wu Yuan: \"As a general rule, those who are\nwaging war should get rid of all the domestic troubles before\nproceeding to attack the external foe.\"]\n\n3. After that, comes tactical manœuvering, than which there is nothing\nmore difficult.\n\n[I have departed slightly from the traditional interpretation of Ts’ao\nKung, who says: \"From the time of receiving the sovereign’s\ninstructions until our encampment over against the enemy, the tactics\nto be pursued are most difficult.\" It seems to me that the tactics or\nmanœuvers can hardly be said to begin until the army has sallied forth\nand encamped, and Ch’ien Hao’s note gives color to this view: \"For\nlevying, concentrating, harmonizing and entrenching an army, there are\nplenty of old rules which will serve. The real difficulty comes when we\nengage in tactical operations.\" Tu Yu also observes that \"the great\ndifficulty is to be beforehand with the enemy in seizing favourable\nposition.\"]",
      "The difficulty of tactical manœuvering consists in turning the devious\ninto the direct, and misfortune into gain.\n\n[This sentence contains one of those highly condensed and somewhat\nenigmatical expressions of which Sun Tzŭ is so fond. This is how it is\nexplained by Ts’ao Kung: \"Make it appear that you are a long way off,\nthen cover the distance rapidly and arrive on the scene before your\nopponent.\" Tu Mu says: \"Hoodwink the enemy, so that he may be remiss\nand leisurely while you are dashing along with utmost speed.\" Ho Shih\ngives a slightly different turn: \"Although you may have difficult\nground to traverse and natural obstacles to encounter this is a\ndrawback which can be turned into actual advantage by celerity of\nmovement.\" Signal examples of this saying are afforded by the two\nfamous passages across the Alps—that of Hannibal, which laid Italy at\nhis mercy, and that of Napoleon two thousand years later, which\nresulted in the great victory of Marengo.]\n\n4. Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy\nout of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the\ngoal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of _deviation_.",
      "[Tu Mu cites the famous march of Chao She in 270 B.C. to relieve the\ntown of O-yu, which was closely invested by a Ch’in army. The King of\nChao first consulted Lien P’o on the advisability of attempting a\nrelief, but the latter thought the distance too great, and the\nintervening country too rugged and difficult. His Majesty then turned\nto Chao She, who fully admitted the hazardous nature of the march, but\nfinally said: \"We shall be like two rats fighting in a whole—and the\npluckier one will win!\" So he left the capital with his army, but had\nonly gone a distance of 30 _li_ when he stopped and began throwing up\nentrenchments. For 28 days he continued strengthening his\nfortifications, and took care that spies should carry the intelligence\nto the enemy. The Ch’in general was overjoyed, and attributed his\nadversary’s tardiness to the fact that the beleaguered city was in the\nHan State, and thus not actually part of Chao territory. But the spies\nhad no sooner departed than Chao She began a forced march lasting for\ntwo days and one night, and arrive on the scene of action with such\nastonishing rapidity that he was able to occupy a commanding position\non the \"North hill\" before the enemy had got wind of his movements. A\ncrushing defeat followed for the Ch’in forces, who were obliged to\nraise the siege of O-yu in all haste and retreat across the border.]",
      "5. Manœuvering with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined\nmultitude, most dangerous.\n\n[I adopt the reading of the _T’ung Tien_, Cheng Yu-hsien and the _T’u\nShu_, since they appear to apply the exact nuance required in order to\nmake sense. The commentators using the standard text take this line to\nmean that manœuvers may be profitable, or they may be dangerous: it all\ndepends on the ability of the general.]\n\n6. If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an\nadvantage, the chances are that you will be too late. On the other\nhand, to detach a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice\nof its baggage and stores.\n\n[Some of the Chinese text is unintelligible to the Chinese\ncommentators, who paraphrase the sentence. I submit my own rendering\nwithout much enthusiasm, being convinced that there is some deep-seated\ncorruption in the text. On the whole, it is clear that Sun Tzŭ does not\napprove of a lengthy march being undertaken without supplies. Cf.\ninfra, § 11.]\n\n7. Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make\nforced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual\ndistance at a stretch,\n\n[The ordinary day’s march, according to Tu Mu, was 30 _li_; but on one\noccasion, when pursuing Liu Pei, Ts’ao Ts’ao is said to have covered\nthe incredible distance of 300 _li_ within twenty-four hours.]",
      "doing a hundred _li_ in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all\nyour three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.\n\n8. The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind,\nand on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its\ndestination.\n\n[The moral is, as Ts’ao Kung and others point out: Don’t march a\nhundred _li_ to gain a tactical advantage, either with or without\nimpedimenta. Manœuvers of this description should be confined to short\ndistances. Stonewall Jackson said: \"The hardships of forced marches are\noften more painful than the dangers of battle.\" He did not often call\nupon his troops for extraordinary exertions. It was only when he\nintended a surprise, or when a rapid retreat was imperative, that he\nsacrificed everything for speed. [1] ]\n\n9. If you march fifty _li_ in order to outmanœuver the enemy, you will\nlose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will\nreach the goal.\n\n[Literally, \"the leader of the first division will be _torn away_.\"]\n\n10. If you march thirty _li_ with the same object, two-thirds of your\narmy will arrive.\n\n[In the _T’ung Tien_ is added: \"From this we may know the difficulty of\nmanœuvering.\"]\n\n11. We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost;\nwithout provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.",
      "[I think Sun Tzŭ meant \"stores accumulated in dépôts.\" But Tu Yu says\n\"fodder and the like,\" Chang Yu says \"Goods in general,\" and Wang Hsi\nsays \"fuel, salt, foodstuffs, etc.\"]\n\n12. We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the\ndesigns of our neighbours.\n\n13. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar\nwith the face of the country—its mountains and forests, its pitfalls\nand precipices, its marshes and swamps.\n\n14. We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we\nmake use of local guides.\n\n[§§. 12-14 are repeated in chap. XI. § 52.]\n\n15. In war, practise dissimulation, and you will succeed.\n\n[In the tactics of Turenne, deception of the enemy, especially as to\nthe numerical strength of his troops, took a very prominent position.\n[2] ]\n\nMove only if there is a real advantage to be gained.\n\n16. Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops, must be decided by\ncircumstances.\n\n17. Let your rapidity be that of the wind,\n\n[The simile is doubly appropriate, because the wind is not only swift\nbut, as Mei Yao-ch’en points out, \"invisible and leaves no tracks.\"]\n\nyour compactness that of the forest.",
      "[Meng Shih comes nearer to the mark in his note: \"When slowly marching,\norder and ranks must be preserved\"—so as to guard against surprise\nattacks. But natural forest do not grow in rows, whereas they do\ngenerally possess the quality of density or compactness.]\n\n18. In raiding and plundering be like fire,\n\n[Cf. _Shih Ching_, IV. 3. iv. 6: \"Fierce as a blazing fire which no man\ncan check.\"]\n\nin immovability like a mountain.\n\n[That is, when holding a position from which the enemy is trying to\ndislodge you, or perhaps, as Tu Yu says, when he is trying to entice\nyou into a trap.]\n\n19. Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you\nmove, fall like a thunderbolt.\n\n[Tu Yu quotes a saying of T’ai Kung which has passed into a proverb:\n\"You cannot shut your ears to the thunder or your eyes to the\nlighting—so rapid are they.\" Likewise, an attack should be made so\nquickly that it cannot be parried.]\n\n20. When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst\nyour men;\n\n[Sun Tzŭ wishes to lessen the abuses of indiscriminate plundering by\ninsisting that all booty shall be thrown into a common stock, which may\nafterwards be fairly divided amongst all.]\n\nwhen you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the\nbenefit of the soldiery.",
      "[Ch’en Hao says \"quarter your soldiers on the land, and let them sow\nand plant it.\" It is by acting on this principle, and harvesting the\nlands they invaded, that the Chinese have succeeded in carrying out\nsome of their most memorable and triumphant expeditions, such as that\nof Pan Ch’ao who penetrated to the Caspian, and in more recent years,\nthose of Fu-k’ang-an and Tso Tsung-t’ang.]\n\n21. Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.\n\n[Chang Yu quotes Wei Liao Tzŭ as saying that we must not break camp\nuntil we have gained the resisting power of the enemy and the\ncleverness of the opposing general. Cf. the \"seven comparisons\" in I. §\n13.]\n\n22. He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation.\n\n[See _supra_, §§ 3, 4.]\n\nSuch is the art of manœuvering.\n\n[With these words, the chapter would naturally come to an end. But\nthere now follows a long appendix in the shape of an extract from an\nearlier book on War, now lost, but apparently extant at the time when\nSun Tzŭ wrote. The style of this fragment is not noticeably different\nfrom that of Sun Tzŭ himself, but no commentator raises a doubt as to\nits genuineness.]\n\n23. The Book of Army Management says:",
      "[It is perhaps significant that none of the earlier commentators give\nus any information about this work. Mei Yao- Ch’en calls it \"an ancient\nmilitary classic,\" and Wang Hsi, \"an old book on war.\" Considering the\nenormous amount of fighting that had gone on for centuries before Sun\nTzŭ’s time between the various kingdoms and principalities of China, it\nis not in itself improbable that a collection of military maxims should\nhave been made and written down at some earlier period.]\n\nOn the field of battle,\n\n[Implied, though not actually in the Chinese.]\n\nthe spoken word does not carry far enough: hence the institution of\ngongs and drums. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough: hence\nthe institution of banners and flags.\n\n24. Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby the ears and\neyes of the host may be focussed on one particular point.\n\n[Chang Yu says: \"If sight and hearing converge simultaneously on the\nsame object, the evolutions of as many as a million soldiers will be\nlike those of a single man.\"!]\n\n25. The host thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either\nfor the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone.",
      "[Chuang Yu quotes a saying: \"Equally guilty are those who advance\nagainst orders and those who retreat against orders.\" Tu Mu tells a\nstory in this connection of Wu Ch’i, when he was fighting against the\nCh’in State. Before the battle had begun, one of his soldiers, a man of\nmatchless daring, sallied forth by himself, captured two heads from the\nenemy, and returned to camp. Wu Ch’i had the man instantly executed,\nwhereupon an officer ventured to remonstrate, saying: \"This man was a\ngood soldier, and ought not to have been beheaded.\" Wu Ch’i replied: \"I\nfully believe he was a good soldier, but I had him beheaded because he\nacted without orders.\"]\n\nThis is the art of handling large masses of men.\n\n26. In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires and drums,\nand in fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means of influencing\nthe ears and eyes of your army.\n\n[Ch’en Hao alludes to Li Kuang-pi’s night ride to Ho-yang at the head\nof 500 mounted men; they made such an imposing display with torches,\nthat though the rebel leader Shih Ssu-ming had a large army, he did not\ndare to dispute their passage.]\n\n27. A whole army may be robbed of its spirit;",
      "[\"In war,\" says Chang Yu, \"if a spirit of anger can be made to pervade\nall ranks of an army at one and the same time, its onset will be\nirresistible. Now the spirit of the enemy’s soldiers will be keenest\nwhen they have newly arrived on the scene, and it is therefore our cue\nnot to fight at once, but to wait until their ardor and enthusiasm have\nworn off, and then strike. It is in this way that they may be robbed of\ntheir keen spirit.\" Li Ch’uan and others tell an anecdote (to be found\nin the _Tso Chuan_, year 10, § 1) of Ts’ao Kuei, a protege of Duke\nChuang of Lu. The latter State was attacked by Ch’i, and the duke was\nabout to join battle at Ch’ang-cho, after the first roll of the enemy’s\ndrums, when Ts’ao said: \"Not just yet.\" Only after their drums had\nbeaten for the third time, did he give the word for attack. Then they\nfought, and the men of Ch’i were utterly defeated. Questioned\nafterwards by the Duke as to the meaning of his delay, Ts’ao Kuei\nreplied: \"In battle, a courageous spirit is everything. Now the first\nroll of the drum tends to create this spirit, but with the second it is\nalready on the wane, and after the third it is gone altogether. I\nattacked when their spirit was gone and ours was at its height. Hence\nour victory.\" Wu Tzŭ (chap. 4) puts \"spirit\" first among the \"four\nimportant influences\" in war, and continues: \"The value of a whole\narmy—a mighty host of a million men—is dependent on one man alone: such\nis the influence of spirit!\"]",
      "a commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.\n\n[Chang Yu says: \"Presence of mind is the general’s most important\nasset. It is the quality which enables him to discipline disorder and\nto inspire courage into the panic-stricken.\" The great general Li Ching\n(A.D. 571-649) has a saying: \"Attacking does not merely consist in\nassaulting walled cities or striking at an army in battle array; it\nmust include the art of assailing the enemy’s mental equilibrium.\"]\n\n28. Now a soldier’s spirit is keenest in the morning;\n\n[Always provided, I suppose, that he has had breakfast. At the battle\nof the Trebia, the Romans were foolishly allowed to fight fasting,\nwhereas Hannibal’s men had breakfasted at their leisure. See Livy, XXI,\nliv. 8, lv. 1 and 8.]\n\nby noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent\nonly on returning to camp.\n\n29. A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its spirit is\nkeen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return. This\nis the art of studying moods.\n\n30. Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and\nhubbub amongst the enemy:—this is the art of retaining self-possession.\n\n31. To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait\nat ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well-fed while\nthe enemy is famished:—this is the art of husbanding one’s strength.",
      "32. To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect\norder, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident\narray:—this is the art of studying circumstances.\n\n33. It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor\nto oppose him when he comes downhill.\n\n34. Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers\nwhose temper is keen.\n\n35. Do not swallow a bait offered by the enemy.\n\n[Li Ch’uan and Tu Mu, with extraordinary inability to see a metaphor,\ntake these words quite literally of food and drink that have been\npoisoned by the enemy. Ch’en Hao and Chang Yu carefully point out that\nthe saying has a wider application.]\n\nDo not interfere with an army that is returning home.",
      "[The commentators explain this rather singular piece of advice by\nsaying that a man whose heart is set on returning home will fight to\nthe death against any attempt to bar his way, and is therefore too\ndangerous an opponent to be tackled. Chang Yu quotes the words of Han\nHsin: \"Invincible is the soldier who hath his desire and returneth\nhomewards.\" A marvelous tale is told of Ts’ao Ts’ao’s courage and\nresource in ch. 1 of the _San Kuo Chi_, In 198 A.D., he was besieging\nChang Hsiu in Jang, when Liu Piao sent reinforcements with a view to\ncutting off Ts’ao’s retreat. The latter was obliged to draw off his\ntroops, only to find himself hemmed in between two enemies, who were\nguarding each outlet of a narrow pass in which he had engaged himself.\nIn this desperate plight Ts’ao waited until nightfall, when he bored a\ntunnel into the mountain side and laid an ambush in it. As soon as the\nwhole army had passed by, the hidden troops fell on his rear, while\nTs’ao himself turned and met his pursuers in front, so that they were\nthrown into confusion and annihilated. Ts’ao Ts’ao said afterwards:\n\"The brigands tried to check my army in its retreat and brought me to\nbattle in a desperate position: hence I knew how to overcome them.\"]\n\n36. When you surround an army, leave an outlet free.",
      "[This does not mean that the enemy is to be allowed to escape. The\nobject, as Tu Mu puts it, is \"to make him believe that there is a road\nto safety, and thus prevent his fighting with the courage of despair.\"\nTu Mu adds pleasantly: \"After that, you may crush him.\"]\n\nDo not press a desperate foe too hard.",
      "[Ch’en Hao quotes the saying: \"Birds and beasts when brought to bay\nwill use their claws and teeth.\" Chang Yu says: \"If your adversary has\nburned his boats and destroyed his cooking-pots, and is ready to stake\nall on the issue of a battle, he must not be pushed to extremities.\" Ho\nShih illustrates the meaning by a story taken from the life of\nYen-ch’ing. That general, together with his colleague Tu Chung-wei was\nsurrounded by a vastly superior army of Khitans in the year 945 A.D.\nThe country was bare and desert-like, and the little Chinese force was\nsoon in dire straits for want of water. The wells they bored ran dry,\nand the men were reduced to squeezing lumps of mud and sucking out the\nmoisture. Their ranks thinned rapidly, until at last Fu Yen-ch’ing\nexclaimed: \"We are desperate men. Far better to die for our country\nthan to go with fettered hands into captivity!\" A strong gale happened\nto be blowing from the northeast and darkening the air with dense\nclouds of sandy dust. To Chung-wei was for waiting until this had\nabated before deciding on a final attack; but luckily another officer,\nLi Shou-cheng by name, was quicker to see an opportunity, and said:\n\"They are many and we are few, but in the midst of this sandstorm our\nnumbers will not be discernible; victory will go to the strenuous\nfighter, and the wind will be our best ally.\" Accordingly, Fu\nYen-ch’ing made a sudden and wholly unexpected onslaught with his\ncavalry, routed the barbarians and succeeded in breaking through to\nsafety.]",

VARIATION OF TACTICS\n\n[The heading means literally \"The Nine Variations,\" but as Sun Tzŭ does\nnot appear to enumerate these, and as, indeed, he has already told us\n(V §§ 6-11) that such deflections from the ordinary course are\npractically innumerable, we have little option but to follow Wang Hsi,\nwho says that \"Nine\" stands for an indefinitely large number. \"All it\nmeans is that in warfare we ought to vary our tactics to the utmost\ndegree…. I do not know what Ts’ao Kung makes these Nine Variations out\nto be, but it has been suggested that they are connected with the Nine\nSituations\" - of chapt. XI. This is the view adopted by Chang Yu. The\nonly other alternative is to suppose that something has been lost—a\nsupposition to which the unusual shortness of the chapter lends some\nweight.]\n\n1. Sun Tzŭ said: In war, the general receives his commands from the\nsovereign, collects his army and concentrates his forces.\n\n[Repeated from VII. § 1, where it is certainly more in place. It may\nhave been interpolated here merely in order to supply a beginning to\nthe chapter.]",
      "2. When in difficult country, do not encamp. In country where high\nroads intersect, join hands with your allies. Do not linger in\ndangerously isolated positions.\n\n[The last situation is not one of the Nine Situations as given in the\nbeginning of chap. XI, but occurs later on (ibid. § 43. q.v.). Chang Yu\ndefines this situation as being situated across the frontier, in\nhostile territory. Li Ch’uan says it is \"country in which there are no\nsprings or wells, flocks or herds, vegetables or firewood;\" Chia Lin,\n\"one of gorges, chasms and precipices, without a road by which to\nadvance.\"]\n\nIn hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem. In a desperate\nposition, you must fight.\n\n3. There are roads which must not be followed,\n\n[\"Especially those leading through narrow defiles,\" says Li Ch’uan,\n\"where an ambush is to be feared.\"]\n\narmies which must be not attacked,\n\n[More correctly, perhaps, \"there are times when an army must not be\nattacked.\" Ch’en Hao says: \"When you see your way to obtain a rival\nadvantage, but are powerless to inflict a real defeat, refrain from\nattacking, for fear of overtaxing your men’s strength.\"]\n\ntowns which must not be besieged,",
      "[Cf. III. § 4 Ts’ao Kung gives an interesting illustration from his own\nexperience. When invading the territory of Hsu-chou, he ignored the\ncity of Hua-pi, which lay directly in his path, and pressed on into the\nheart of the country. This excellent strategy was rewarded by the\nsubsequent capture of no fewer than fourteen important district cities.\nChang Yu says: \"No town should be attacked which, if taken, cannot be\nheld, or if left alone, will not cause any trouble.\" Hsun Ying, when\nurged to attack Pi-yang, replied: \"The city is small and\nwell-fortified; even if I succeed intaking it, it will be no great feat\nof arms; whereas if I fail, I shall make myself a laughing-stock.\" In\nthe seventeenth century, sieges still formed a large proportion of war.\nIt was Turenne who directed attention to the importance of marches,\ncountermarches and manœuvers. He said: \"It is a great mistake to waste\nmen in taking a town when the same expenditure of soldiers will gain a\nprovince.\" [1] ]\n\npositions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which\nmust not be obeyed.",
      "[This is a hard saying for the Chinese, with their reverence for\nauthority, and Wei Liao Tzŭ (quoted by Tu Mu) is moved to exclaim:\n\"Weapons are baleful instruments, strife is antagonistic to virtue, a\nmilitary commander is the negation of civil order!\" The unpalatable\nfact remains, however, that even Imperial wishes must be subordinated\nto military necessity.]\n\n4. The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany\nvariation of tactics knows how to handle his troops.\n\n5. The general who does not understand these, may be well acquainted\nwith the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn\nhis knowledge to practical account.\n\n[Literally, \"get the advantage of the ground,\" which means not only\nsecuring good positions, but availing oneself of natural advantages in\nevery possible way. Chang Yu says: \"Every kind of ground is\ncharacterized by certain natural features, and also gives scope for a\ncertain variability of plan. How it is possible to turn these natural\nfeatures to account unless topographical knowledge is supplemented by\nversatility of mind?\"]\n\n6. So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying\nhis plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will\nfail to make the best use of his men.",
      "[Chia Lin tells us that these imply five obvious and generally\nadvantageous lines of action, namely: \"if a certain road is short, it\nmust be followed; if an army is isolated, it must be attacked; if a\ntown is in a parlous condition, it must be besieged; if a position can\nbe stormed, it must be attempted; and if consistent with military\noperations, the ruler’s commands must be obeyed.\" But there are\ncircumstances which sometimes forbid a general to use these advantages.\nFor instance, \"a certain road may be the shortest way for him, but if\nhe knows that it abounds in natural obstacles, or that the enemy has\nlaid an ambush on it, he will not follow that road. A hostile force may\nbe open to attack, but if he knows that it is hard-pressed and likely\nto fight with desperation, he will refrain from striking,\" and so on.]\n\n7. Hence in the wise leader’s plans, considerations of advantage and of\ndisadvantage will be blended together.\n\n[\"Whether in an advantageous position or a disadvantageous one,\" says\nTs’ao Kung, \"the opposite state should be always present to your\nmind.\"]\n\n8. If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may\nsucceed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes.",
      "[Tu Mu says: \"If we wish to wrest an advantage from the enemy, we must\nnot fix our minds on that alone, but allow for the possibility of the\nenemy also doing some harm to us, and let this enter as a factor into\nour calculations.\"]\n\n9. If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always\nready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from\nmisfortune.\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"If I wish to extricate myself from a dangerous position,\nI must consider not only the enemy’s ability to injure me, but also my\nown ability to gain an advantage over the enemy. If in my counsels\nthese two considerations are properly blended, I shall succeed in\nliberating myself…. For instance; if I am surrounded by the enemy and\nonly think of effecting an escape, the nervelessness of my policy will\nincite my adversary to pursue and crush me; it would be far better to\nencourage my men to deliver a bold counter-attack, and use the\nadvantage thus gained to free myself from the enemy’s toils.\" See the\nstory of Ts’ao Ts’ao, VII. § 35, note.]\n\n10. Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them;",
      "[Chia Lin enumerates several ways of inflicting this injury, some of\nwhich would only occur to the Oriental mind:—\"Entice away the enemy’s\nbest and wisest men, so that he may be left without counselors.\nIntroduce traitors into his country, that the government policy may be\nrendered futile. Foment intrigue and deceit, and thus sow dissension\nbetween the ruler and his ministers. By means of every artful\ncontrivance, cause deterioration amongst his men and waste of his\ntreasure. Corrupt his morals by insidious gifts leading him into\nexcess. Disturb and unsettle his mind by presenting him with lovely\nwomen.\" Chang Yu (after Wang Hsi) makes a different interpretation of\nSun Tzŭ here: \"Get the enemy into a position where he must suffer\ninjury, and he will submit of his own accord.\"]\n\nand make trouble for them,\n\n[Tu Mu, in this phrase, in his interpretation indicates that trouble\nshould be made for the enemy affecting their \"possessions,\" or, as we\nmight say, \"assets,\" which he considers to be \"a large army, a rich\nexchequer, harmony amongst the soldiers, punctual fulfillment of\ncommands.\" These give us a whip-hand over the enemy.]\n\nand keep them constantly engaged;\n\n[Literally, \"make servants of them.\" Tu Yu says \"prevent them from\nhaving any rest.\"]\n\nhold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.",
      "[Meng Shih’s note contains an excellent example of the idiomatic use\nof: \"cause them to forget _pien_ (the reasons for acting otherwise than\non their first impulse), and hasten in our direction.\"]\n\n11. The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the\nenemy’s not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the\nchance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made\nour position unassailable.\n\n12. There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: (1)\nRecklessness, which leads to destruction;\n\n[\"Bravery without forethought,\" as Ts’ao Kung analyzes it, which causes\na man to fight blindly and desperately like a mad bull. Such an\nopponent, says Chang Yu, \"must not be encountered with brute force, but\nmay be lured into an ambush and slain.\" Cf. Wu Tzŭ, chap. IV. ad init.:\n\"In estimating the character of a general, men are wont to pay\nexclusive attention to his courage, forgetting that courage is only one\nout of many qualities which a general should possess. The merely brave\nman is prone to fight recklessly; and he who fights recklessly, without\nany perception of what is expedient, must be condemned.\" Ssu-ma Fa,\ntoo, makes the incisive remark: \"Simply going to one’s death does not\nbring about victory.\"]\n\n(2) cowardice, which leads to capture;",
      "[Ts’ao Kung defines the Chinese word translated here as \"cowardice\" as\nbeing of the man \"whom timidity prevents from advancing to seize an\nadvantage,\" and Wang Hsi adds \"who is quick to flee at the sight of\ndanger.\" Meng Shih gives the closer paraphrase \"he who is bent on\nreturning alive,\" this is, the man who will never take a risk. But, as\nSun Tzŭ knew, nothing is to be achieved in war unless you are willing\nto take risks. T’ai Kung said: \"He who lets an advantage slip will\nsubsequently bring upon himself real disaster.\" In 404 A.D., Liu Yu\npursued the rebel Huan Hsuan up the Yangtsze and fought a naval battle\nwith him at the island of Ch’eng-hung. The loyal troops numbered only a\nfew thousands, while their opponents were in great force. But Huan\nHsuan, fearing the fate which was in store for him should be be\novercome, had a light boat made fast to the side of his war-junk, so\nthat he might escape, if necessary, at a moment’s notice. The natural\nresult was that the fighting spirit of his soldiers was utterly\nquenched, and when the loyalists made an attack from windward with\nfireships, all striving with the utmost ardor to be first in the fray,\nHuan Hsuan’s forces were routed, had to burn all their baggage and fled\nfor two days and nights without stopping. Chang Yu tells a somewhat\nsimilar story of Chao Ying-ch’i, a general of the Chin State who during\na battle with the army of Ch’u in 597 B.C. had a boat kept in readiness\nfor him on the river, wishing in case of defeat to be the first to get\nacross.]",
      "(3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults;\n\n[Tu Mu tells us that Yao Hsing, when opposed in 357 A.D. by Huang Mei,\nTeng Ch’iang and others shut himself up behind his walls and refused to\nfight. Teng Ch’iang said: \"Our adversary is of a choleric temper and\neasily provoked; let us make constant sallies and break down his walls,\nthen he will grow angry and come out. Once we can bring his force to\nbattle, it is doomed to be our prey.\" This plan was acted upon, Yao\nHsiang came out to fight, was lured as far as San-yuan by the enemy’s\npretended flight, and finally attacked and slain.]\n\n(4) a delicacy of honour which is sensitive to shame;\n\nThis need not be taken to mean that a sense of honour is really a defect\nin a general. What Sun Tzŭ condemns is rather an exaggerated\nsensitiveness to slanderous reports, the thin-skinned man who is stung\nby opprobrium, however undeserved. Mei Yao-ch’en truly observes, though\nsomewhat paradoxically: \"The seeker after glory should be careless of\npublic opinion.\"]\n\n(5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and\ntrouble.",
      "[Here again, Sun Tzŭ does not mean that the general is to be careless\nof the welfare of his troops. All he wishes to emphasize is the danger\nof sacrificing any important military advantage to the immediate\ncomfort of his men. This is a shortsighted policy, because in the long\nrun the troops will suffer more from the defeat, or, at best, the\nprolongation of the war, which will be the consequence. A mistaken\nfeeling of pity will often induce a general to relieve a beleaguered\ncity, or to reinforce a hard-pressed detachment, contrary to his\nmilitary instincts. It is now generally admitted that our repeated\nefforts to relieve Ladysmith in the South African War were so many\nstrategical blunders which defeated their own purpose. And in the end,\nrelief came through the very man who started out with the distinct\nresolve no longer to subordinate the interests of the whole to\nsentiment in favour of a part. An old soldier of one of our generals who\nfailed most conspicuously in this war, tried once, I remember, to\ndefend him to me on the ground that he was always \"so good to his men.\"\nBy this plea, had he but known it, he was only condemning him out of\nSun Tzŭ’s mouth.]\n\n13. These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the\nconduct of war.",
      "14. When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will\nsurely be found among these five dangerous faults. Let them be a\nsubject of meditation.\n\n[1] \"Marshal Turenne,\" p. 50.\n\nChapter IX. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH\n\n[The contents of this interesting chapter are better indicated in § 1\nthan by this heading.]\n\n1. Sun Tzŭ said: We come now to the question of encamping the army, and\nobserving signs of the enemy. Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in\nthe neighbourhood of valleys.\n\n[The idea is, not to linger among barren uplands, but to keep close to\nsupplies of water and grass. Cf. Wu Tzŭ, ch. 3: \"Abide not in natural\novens,\" i.e. \"the openings of valleys.\" Chang Yu tells the following\nanecdote: Wu-tu Ch’iang was a robber captain in the time of the Later\nHan, and Ma Yuan was sent to exterminate his gang. Ch’iang having found\na refuge in the hills, Ma Yuan made no attempt to force a battle, but\nseized all the favourable positions commanding supplies of water and\nforage. Ch’iang was soon in such a desperate plight for want of\nprovisions that he was forced to make a total surrender. He did not\nknow the advantage of keeping in the neighbourhood of valleys.\"]\n\n2. Camp in high places,\n\n[Not on high hills, but on knolls or hillocks elevated above the\nsurrounding country.]\n\nfacing the sun.",
      "[Tu Mu takes this to mean \"facing south,\" and Ch’en Hao \"facing east.\"\nCf. infra, §§ 11, 13.\n\nDo not climb heights in order to fight. So much for mountain warfare.\n\n3. After crossing a river, you should get far away from it.\n\n[\"In order to tempt the enemy to cross after you,\" according to Ts’ao\nKung, and also, says Chang Yu, \"in order not to be impeded in your\nevolutions.\" The _T’ung Tien_ reads, \"If _the enemy_ crosses a river,\"\netc. But in view of the next sentence, this is almost certainly an\ninterpolation.]\n\n4. When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do not\nadvance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army\nget across, and then deliver your attack.",
      "[Li Ch’uan alludes to the great victory won by Han Hsin over Lung Chu\nat the Wei River. Turning to the _Ch’ien Han Shu_, ch. 34, fol. 6\nverso, we find the battle described as follows: \"The two armies were\ndrawn up on opposite sides of the river. In the night, Han Hsin ordered\nhis men to take some ten thousand sacks filled with sand and construct\na dam higher up. Then, leading half his army across, he attacked Lung\nChu; but after a time, pretending to have failed in his attempt, he\nhastily withdrew to the other bank. Lung Chu was much elated by this\nunlooked-for success, and exclaiming: \"I felt sure that Han Hsin was\nreally a coward!\" he pursued him and began crossing the river in his\nturn. Han Hsin now sent a party to cut open the sandbags, thus\nreleasing a great volume of water, which swept down and prevented the\ngreater portion of Lung Chu’s army from getting across. He then turned\nupon the force which had been cut off, and annihilated it, Lung Chu\nhimself being amongst the slain. The rest of the army, on the further\nbank, also scattered and fled in all directions.]\n\n5. If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader\nnear a river which he has to cross.\n\n[For fear of preventing his crossing.]\n\n6. Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun.",
      "[See _supra_, § 2. The repetition of these words in connection with\nwater is very awkward. Chang Yu has the note: \"Said either of troops\nmarshalled on the river-bank, or of boats anchored in the stream itself;\nin either case it is essential to be higher than the enemy and facing\nthe sun.\" The other commentators are not at all explicit.]\n\nDo not move up-stream to meet the enemy.\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"As water flows downwards, we must not pitch our camp on\nthe lower reaches of a river, for fear the enemy should open the\nsluices and sweep us away in a flood. Chu-ko Wu-hou has remarked that\n‘in river warfare we must not advance against the stream,’ which is as\nmuch as to say that our fleet must not be anchored below that of the\nenemy, for then they would be able to take advantage of the current and\nmake short work of us.\" There is also the danger, noted by other\ncommentators, that the enemy may throw poison on the water to be\ncarried down to us.]\n\nSo much for river warfare.\n\n7. In crossing salt-marshes, your sole concern should be to get over\nthem quickly, without any delay.\n\n[Because of the lack of fresh water, the poor quality of the herbage,\nand last but not least, because they are low, flat, and exposed to\nattack.]\n\n8. If forced to fight in a salt-marsh, you should have water and grass\nnear you, and get your back to a clump of trees.",
      "[Li Ch’uan remarks that the ground is less likely to be treacherous\nwhere there are trees, while Tu Mu says that they will serve to protect\nthe rear.]\n\nSo much for operations in salt-marshes.\n\n9. In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible position with\nrising ground to your right and on your rear,\n\n[Tu Mu quotes T’ai Kung as saying: \"An army should have a stream or a\nmarsh on its left, and a hill or tumulus on its right.\"]\n\nso that the danger may be in front, and safety lie behind. So much for\ncampaigning in flat country.\n\n10. These are the four useful branches of military knowledge\n\n[Those, namely, concerned with (1) mountains, (2) rivers, (3) marshes,\nand (4) plains. Compare Napoleon’s \"Military Maxims,\" no. 1.]\n\nwhich enabled the Yellow Emperor to vanquish four several sovereigns.",
      "[Regarding the \"Yellow Emperor\": Mei Yao-ch’en asks, with some\nplausibility, whether there is an error in the text as nothing is known\nof Huang Ti having conquered four other Emperors. The _Shih Chi_ (ch. 1\nad init.) speaks only of his victories over Yen Ti and Ch’ih Yu. In the\n_Liu T’ao_ it is mentioned that he \"fought seventy battles and pacified\nthe Empire.\" Ts’ao Kung’s explanation is, that the Yellow Emperor was\nthe first to institute the feudal system of vassals princes, each of\nwhom (to the number of four) originally bore the title of Emperor. Li\nCh’uan tells us that the art of war originated under Huang Ti, who\nreceived it from his Minister Feng Hou.]\n\n11. All armies prefer high ground to low,\n\n[\"High Ground,\" says Mei Yao-ch’en, \"is not only more agreeable and\nsalubrious, but more convenient from a military point of view; low\nground is not only damp and unhealthy, but also disadvantageous for\nfighting.\"]\n\nand sunny places to dark.\n\n12. If you are careful of your men,\n\n[Ts’ao Kung says: \"Make for fresh water and pasture, where you can turn\nout your animals to graze.\"]\n\nand camp on hard ground, the army will be free from disease of every\nkind,\n\n[Chang Yu says: \"The dryness of the climate will prevent the outbreak\nof illness.\"]\n\nand this will spell victory.",
      "13. When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the sunny side, with the\nslope on your right rear. Thus you will at once act for the benefit of\nyour soldiers and utilise the natural advantages of the ground.\n\n14. When, in consequence of heavy rains up-country, a river which you\nwish to ford is swollen and flecked with foam, you must wait until it\nsubsides.\n\n15. Country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running\nbetween, deep natural hollows,\n\nThe latter defined as \"places enclosed on every side by steep banks,\nwith pools of water at the bottom.\"]\n\nconfined places,\n\n[Defined as \"natural pens or prisons\" or \"places surrounded by\nprecipices on three sides—easy to get into, but hard to get out of.\"]\n\ntangled thickets,\n\n[Defined as \"places covered with such dense undergrowth that spears\ncannot be used.\"]\n\nquagmires\n\n[Defined as \"low-lying places, so heavy with mud as to be impassable\nfor chariots and horsemen.\"]\n\nand crevasses,",
      "[Defined by Mei Yao-ch’en as \"a narrow difficult way between beetling\ncliffs.\" Tu Mu’s note is \"ground covered with trees and rocks, and\nintersected by numerous ravines and pitfalls.\" This is very vague, but\nChia Lin explains it clearly enough as a defile or narrow pass, and\nChang Yu takes much the same view. On the whole, the weight of the\ncommentators certainly inclines to the rendering \"defile.\" But the\nordinary meaning of the Chinese in one place is \"a crack or fissure\"\nand the fact that the meaning of the Chinese elsewhere in the sentence\nindicates something in the nature of a defile, make me think that Sun\nTzŭ is here speaking of crevasses.]\n\nshould be left with all possible speed and not approached.\n\n16. While we keep away from such places, we should get the enemy to\napproach them; while we face them, we should let the enemy have them on\nhis rear.\n\n17. If in the neighbourhood of your camp there should be any hilly\ncountry, ponds surrounded by aquatic grass, hollow basins filled with\nreeds, or woods with thick undergrowth, they must be carefully routed\nout and searched; for these are places where men in ambush or insidious\nspies are likely to be lurking.\n\n[Chang Yu has the note: \"We must also be on our guard against traitors\nwho may lie in close covert, secretly spying out our weaknesses and\noverhearing our instructions.\"]",
      "18. When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on\nthe natural strength of his position.\n\n[Here begin Sun Tzŭ’s remarks on the reading of signs, much of which is\nso good that it could almost be included in a modern manual like Gen.\nBaden-Powell’s \"Aids to Scouting.\"]\n\n19. When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle, he is anxious\nfor the other side to advance.\n\n[Probably because we are in a strong position from which he wishes to\ndislodge us. \"If he came close up to us, says Tu Mu, \"and tried to\nforce a battle, he would seem to despise us, and there would be less\nprobability of our responding to the challenge.\"]\n\n20. If his place of encampment is easy of access, he is tendering a\nbait.\n\n21. Movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the enemy is\nadvancing.\n\n[Ts’ao Kung explains this as \"felling trees to clear a passage,\" and\nChang Yu says: \"Every man sends out scouts to climb high places and\nobserve the enemy. If a scout sees that the trees of a forest are\nmoving and shaking, he may know that they are being cut down to clear a\npassage for the enemy’s march.\"]\n\nThe appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass means\nthat the enemy wants to make us suspicious.",
      "[Tu Yu’s explanation, borrowed from Ts’ao Kung’s, is as follows: \"The\npresence of a number of screens or sheds in the midst of thick\nvegetation is a sure sign that the enemy has fled and, fearing pursuit,\nhas constructed these hiding-places in order to make us suspect an\nambush.\" It appears that these \"screens\" were hastily knotted together\nout of any long grass which the retreating enemy happened to come\nacross.]\n\n22. The rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade.\n\n[Chang Yu’s explanation is doubtless right: \"When birds that are flying\nalong in a straight line suddenly shoot upwards, it means that soldiers\nare in ambush at the spot beneath.\"]\n\nStartled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming.\n\n23. When there is dust rising in a high column, it is the sign of\nchariots advancing; when the dust is low, but spread over a wide area,\nit betokens the approach of infantry.",
      "[\"High and sharp,\" or rising to a peak, is of course somewhat\nexaggerated as applied to dust. The commentators explain the phenomenon\nby saying that horses and chariots, being heavier than men, raise more\ndust, and also follow one another in the same wheel-track, whereas\nfoot-soldiers would be marching in ranks, many abreast. According to\nChang Yu, \"every army on the march must have scouts some way in\nadvance, who on sighting dust raised by the enemy, will gallop back and\nreport it to the commander-in-chief.\" Cf. Gen. Baden-Powell: \"As you\nmove along, say, in a hostile country, your eyes should be looking afar\nfor the enemy or any signs of him: figures, dust rising, birds getting\nup, glitter of arms, etc.\" [1] ]\n\nWhen it branches out in different directions, it shows that parties\nhave been sent to collect firewood. A few clouds of dust moving to and\nfro signify that the army is encamping.\n\n[Chang Yu says: \"In apportioning the defences for a cantonment, light\nhorse will be sent out to survey the position and ascertain the weak\nand strong points all along its circumference. Hence the small quantity\nof dust and its motion.\"]\n\n24. Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is\nabout to advance.",
      "[\"As though they stood in great fear of us,\" says Tu Mu. \"Their object\nis to make us contemptuous and careless, after which they will attack\nus.\" Chang Yu alludes to the story of T’ien Tan of the Ch’i-mo against\nthe Yen forces, led by Ch’i Chieh. In ch. 82 of the _Shih Chi_ we read:\n\"T’ien Tan openly said: ‘My only fear is that the Yen army may cut off\nthe noses of their Ch’i prisoners and place them in the front rank to\nfight against us; that would be the undoing of our city.’ The other\nside being informed of this speech, at once acted on the suggestion;\nbut those within the city were enraged at seeing their\nfellow-countrymen thus mutilated, and fearing only lest they should\nfall into the enemy’s hands, were nerved to defend themselves more\nobstinately than ever. Once again T’ien Tan sent back converted spies\nwho reported these words to the enemy: \"What I dread most is that the\nmen of Yen may dig up the ancestral tombs outside the town, and by\ninflicting this indignity on our forefathers cause us to become\nfaint-hearted.’ Forthwith the besiegers dug up all the graves and\nburned the corpses lying in them. And the inhabitants of Chi-mo,\nwitnessing the outrage from the city-walls, wept passionately and were\nall impatient to go out and fight, their fury being increased tenfold.\nT’ien Tan knew then that his soldiers were ready for any enterprise.\nBut instead of a sword, he himself took a mattock in his hands, and\nordered others to be distributed amongst his best warriors, while the\nranks were filled up with their wives and concubines. He then served\nout all the remaining rations and bade his men eat their fill. The\nregular soldiers were told to keep out of sight, and the walls were\nmanned with the old and weaker men and with women. This done, envoys\nwere dispatched to the enemy’s camp to arrange terms of surrender,\nwhereupon the Yen army began shouting for joy. T’ien Tan also collected\n20,000 ounces of silver from the people, and got the wealthy citizens\nof Chi-mo to send it to the Yen general with the prayer that, when the\ntown capitulated, he would not allow their homes to be plundered or\ntheir women to be maltreated. Ch’i Chieh, in high good humor, granted\ntheir prayer; but his army now became increasingly slack and careless.\nMeanwhile, T’ien Tan got together a thousand oxen, decked them with\npieces of red silk, painted their bodies, dragon-like, with colored\nstripes, and fastened sharp blades on their horns and well-greased\nrushes on their tails. When night came on, he lighted the ends of the\nrushes, and drove the oxen through a number of holes which he had\npierced in the walls, backing them up with a force of 5000 picked\nwarriors. The animals, maddened with pain, dashed furiously into the\nenemy’s camp where they caused the utmost confusion and dismay; for\ntheir tails acted as torches, showing up the hideous pattern on their\nbodies, and the weapons on their horns killed or wounded any with whom\nthey came into contact. In the meantime, the band of 5000 had crept up\nwith gags in their mouths, and now threw themselves on the enemy. At\nthe same moment a frightful din arose in the city itself, all those\nthat remained behind making as much noise as possible by banging drums\nand hammering on bronze vessels, until heaven and earth were convulsed\nby the uproar. Terror-stricken, the Yen army fled in disorder, hotly\npursued by the men of Ch’i, who succeeded in slaying their general Ch’i\nChien…. The result of the battle was the ultimate recovery of some\nseventy cities which had belonged to the Ch’i State.\"]",
      "Violent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that\nhe will retreat.\n\n25. When the light chariots come out first and take up a position on\nthe wings, it is a sign that the enemy is forming for battle.\n\n26. Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot.\n\n[The reading here is uncertain. Li Ch’uan indicates \"a treaty confirmed\nby oaths and hostages.\" Wang Hsi and Chang Yu, on the other hand,\nsimply say \"without reason,\" \"on a frivolous pretext.\"]\n\n27. When there is much running about\n\n[Every man hastening to his proper place under his own regimental\nbanner.]\n\nand the soldiers fall into rank, it means that the critical moment has\ncome.\n\n28. When some are seen advancing and some retreating, it is a lure.\n\n29. When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint\nfrom want of food.\n\n30. If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves,\nthe army is suffering from thirst.\n\n[As Tu Mu remarks: \"One may know the condition of a whole army from the\nbehavior of a single man.\"]\n\n31. If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to\nsecure it, the soldiers are exhausted.\n\n32. If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied.\n\n[A useful fact to bear in mind when, for instance, as Ch’en Hao says,\nthe enemy has secretly abandoned his camp.]\n\nClamour by night betokens nervousness.",
      "33. If there is disturbance in the camp, the general’s authority is\nweak. If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is afoot. If\nthe officers are angry, it means that the men are weary.\n\n[Tu Mu understands the sentence differently: \"If all the officers of an\narmy are angry with their general, it means that they are broken with\nfatigue\" owing to the exertions which he has demanded from them.]\n\n34. When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for\nfood,\n\n[In the ordinary course of things, the men would be fed on grain and\nthe horses chiefly on grass.]\n\nand when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the camp-fires,\nshowing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that\nthey are determined to fight to the death.",
      "[I may quote here the illustrative passage from the _Hou Han Shu_, ch.\n71, given in abbreviated form by the _P’ei Wen Yun Fu:_ \"The rebel Wang\nKuo of Liang was besieging the town of Ch’en- ts’ang, and Huang-fu\nSung, who was in supreme command, and Tung Cho were sent out against\nhim. The latter pressed for hasty measures, but Sung turned a deaf ear\nto his counsel. At last the rebels were utterly worn out, and began to\nthrow down their weapons of their own accord. Sung was not advancing to\nthe attack, but Cho said: ‘It is a principle of war not to pursue\ndesperate men and not to press a retreating host.’ Sung answered: ‘That\ndoes not apply here. What I am about to attack is a jaded army, not a\nretreating host; with disciplined troops I am falling on a disorganized\nmultitude, not a band of desperate men.’ Thereupon he advances to the\nattack unsupported by his colleague, and routed the enemy, Wang Kuo\nbeing slain.\"]\n\n35. The sight of men whispering together in small knots or speaking in\nsubdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file.\n\n36. Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his\nresources;\n\n[Because, when an army is hard pressed, as Tu Mu says, there is always\na fear of mutiny, and lavish rewards are given to keep the men in good\ntemper.]\n\ntoo many punishments betray a condition of dire distress.",
      "[Because in such case discipline becomes relaxed, and unwonted severity\nis necessary to keep the men to their duty.]\n\n37. To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at the enemy’s\nnumbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence.\n\n[I follow the interpretation of Ts’ao Kung, also adopted by Li Ch’uan,\nTu Mu, and Chang Yu. Another possible meaning set forth by Tu Yu, Chia\nLin, Mei Tao-ch’en and Wang Hsi, is: \"The general who is first\ntyrannical towards his men, and then in terror lest they should mutiny,\netc.\" This would connect the sentence with what went before about\nrewards and punishments.]\n\n38. When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign\nthat the enemy wishes for a truce.\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"If the enemy open friendly relations be sending hostages,\nit is a sign that they are anxious for an armistice, either because\ntheir strength is exhausted or for some other reason.\" But it hardly\nneeds a Sun Tzŭ to draw such an obvious inference.]\n\n39. If the enemy’s troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a\nlong time without either joining battle or taking themselves off again,\nthe situation is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection.\n\n[Ts’ao Kung says a manœuver of this sort may be only a ruse to gain\ntime for an unexpected flank attack or the laying of an ambush.]",
      "40. If our troops are no more in number than the enemy, that is amply\nsufficient; it only means that no direct attack can be made.\n\n[Literally, \"no martial advance.\" That is to say, _cheng_ tactics and\nfrontal attacks must be eschewed, and stratagem resorted to instead.]\n\nWhat we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength,\nkeep a close watch on the enemy, and obtain reinforcements.\n\n[This is an obscure sentence, and none of the commentators succeed in\nsqueezing very good sense out of it. I follow Li Ch’uan, who appears to\noffer the simplest explanation: \"Only the side that gets more men will\nwin.\" Fortunately we have Chang Yu to expound its meaning to us in\nlanguage which is lucidity itself: \"When the numbers are even, and no\nfavourable opening presents itself, although we may not be strong enough\nto deliver a sustained attack, we can find additional recruits amongst\nour sutlers and camp-followers, and then, concentrating our forces and\nkeeping a close watch on the enemy, contrive to snatch the victory. But\nwe must avoid borrowing foreign soldiers to help us.\" He then quotes\nfrom Wei Liao Tzŭ, ch. 3: \"The nominal strength of mercenary troops may\nbe 100,000, but their real value will be not more than half that\nfigure.\"]\n\n41. He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is\nsure to be captured by them.",
      "[Ch’en Hao, quoting from the _Tso Chuan_, says: \"If bees and scorpions\ncarry poison, how much more will a hostile state! Even a puny opponent,\nthen, should not be treated with contempt.\"]\n\n42. If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you,\nthey will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be\npractically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you,\npunishments are not enforced, they will still be useless.\n\n43. Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with\nhumanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline.\n\n[Yen Tzŭ [B.C. 493] said of Ssu-ma Jang-chu: \"His civil virtues\nendeared him to the people; his martial prowess kept his enemies in\nawe.\" Cf. Wu Tzŭ, ch. 4 init.: \"The ideal commander unites culture with\na warlike temper; the profession of arms requires a combination of\nhardness and tenderness.\"]\n\nThis is a certain road to victory.\n\n44. If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army\nwill be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad.\n\n45. If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his\norders being obeyed,",
      "[Tu Mu says: \"A general ought in time of peace to show kindly\nconfidence in his men and also make his authority respected, so that\nwhen they come to face the enemy, orders may be executed and discipline\nmaintained, because they all trust and look up to him.\" What Sun Tzŭ\nhas said in § 44, however, would lead one rather to expect something\nlike this: \"If a general is always confident that his orders will be\ncarried out,\" etc.\"]\n\nthe gain will be mutual.\n\n[Chang Yu says: \"The general has confidence in the men under his\ncommand, and the men are docile, having confidence in him. Thus the\ngain is mutual.\" He quotes a pregnant sentence from Wei Liao Tzŭ, ch.\n4: \"The art of giving orders is not to try to rectify minor blunders\nand not to be swayed by petty doubts.\" Vacillation and fussiness are\nthe surest means of sapping the confidence of an army.]\n\n[1] \"Aids to Scouting,\" p. 26.\n\nChapter X. TERRAIN\n\n[Only about a third of the chapter, comprising §§ 1-13, deals with\n\"terrain,\" the subject being more fully treated in ch. XI. The \"six\ncalamities\" are discussed in §§ 14-20, and the rest of the chapter is\nagain a mere string of desultory remarks, though not less interesting,\nperhaps, on that account.]\n\n1. Sun Tzŭ said: We may distinguish six kinds of terrain, to wit: (1)\nAccessible ground;\n\n[Mei Yao-ch’en says: \"plentifully provided with roads and means of\ncommunications.\"]",
      "(2) entangling ground;\n\n[The same commentator says: \"Net-like country, venturing into which you\nbecome entangled.\"]\n\n(3) temporising ground;\n\n[Ground which allows you to \"stave off\" or \"delay.\"]\n\n(4) narrow passes; (5) precipitous heights; (6) positions at a great\ndistance from the enemy.\n\n[It is hardly necessary to point out the faultiness of this\nclassification. A strange lack of logical perception is shown in the\nChinaman’s unquestioning acceptance of glaring cross-divisions such as\nthe above.]\n\n2. Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called\n_accessible_.\n\n3. With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy in\noccupying the raised and sunny spots, and carefully guard your line of\nsupplies.",
      "[The general meaning of the last phrase is doubtlessly, as Tu Yu says,\n\"not to allow the enemy to cut your communications.\" In view of\nNapoleon’s dictum, \"the secret of war lies in the communications,\" [1]\nwe could wish that Sun Tzŭ had done more than skirt the edge of this\nimportant subject here and in I. § 10, VII. § 11. Col. Henderson says:\n\"The line of supply may be said to be as vital to the existence of an\narmy as the heart to the life of a human being. Just as the duelist who\nfinds his adversary’s point menacing him with certain death, and his\nown guard astray, is compelled to conform to his adversary’s movements,\nand to content himself with warding off his thrusts, so the commander\nwhose communications are suddenly threatened finds himself in a false\nposition, and he will be fortunate if he has not to change all his\nplans, to split up his force into more or less isolated detachments,\nand to fight with inferior numbers on ground which he has not had time\nto prepare, and where defeat will not be an ordinary failure, but will\nentail the ruin or surrender of his whole army.\" [2]\n\nThen you will be able to fight with advantage.\n\n4. Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy is called\n_entangling_.",
      "5. From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may\nsally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared for your\ncoming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible,\ndisaster will ensue.\n\n6. When the position is such that neither side will gain by making the\nfirst move, it is called _temporising_ ground.\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"Each side finds it inconvenient to move, and the\nsituation remains at a deadlock.\"]\n\n7. In a position of this sort, even though the enemy should offer us an\nattractive bait,\n\n[Tu Yu says, \"turning their backs on us and pretending to flee.\" But\nthis is only one of the lures which might induce us to quit our\nposition.]\n\nit will be advisable not to stir forth, but rather to retreat, thus\nenticing the enemy in his turn; then, when part of his army has come\nout, we may deliver our attack with advantage.\n\n8. With regard to _narrow passes_, if you can occupy them first, let\nthem be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy.\n\n[Because then, as Tu Yu observes, \"the initiative will lie with us, and\nby making sudden and unexpected attacks we shall have the enemy at our\nmercy.\"]\n\n9. Should the enemy forestall you in occupying a pass, do not go after\nhim if the pass is fully garrisoned, but only if it is weakly\ngarrisoned.",
      "10. With regard to _precipitous heights_, if you are beforehand with\nyour adversary, you should occupy the raised and sunny spots, and there\nwait for him to come up.",
      "[Ts’ao Kung says: \"The particular advantage of securing heights and\ndefiles is that your actions cannot then be dictated by the enemy.\"\n[For the enunciation of the grand principle alluded to, see VI. § 2].\nChang Yu tells the following anecdote of P’ei Hsing-chien (A.D.\n619-682), who was sent on a punitive expedition against the Turkic\ntribes. \"At night he pitched his camp as usual, and it had already been\ncompletely fortified by wall and ditch, when suddenly he gave orders\nthat the army should shift its quarters to a hill near by. This was\nhighly displeasing to his officers, who protested loudly against the\nextra fatigue which it would entail on the men. P’ei Hsing-chien,\nhowever, paid no heed to their remonstrances and had the camp moved as\nquickly as possible. The same night, a terrific storm came on, which\nflooded their former place of encampment to the depth of over twelve\nfeet. The recalcitrant officers were amazed at the sight, and owned\nthat they had been in the wrong. ‘How did you know what was going to\nhappen?’ they asked. P’ei Hsing-chien replied: ‘From this time forward\nbe content to obey orders without asking unnecessary questions.’ From\nthis it may be seen,\" Chang Yu continues, \"that high and sunny places\nare advantageous not only for fighting, but also because they are\nimmune from disastrous floods.\"]",
      "11. If the enemy has occupied them before you, do not follow him, but\nretreat and try to entice him away.\n\n[The turning point of Li Shih-min’s campaign in 621 A.D. against the\ntwo rebels, Tou Chien-te, King of Hsia, and Wang Shih-ch’ung, Prince of\nCheng, was his seizure of the heights of Wu-lao, in spite of which Tou\nChien-te persisted in his attempt to relieve his ally in Lo-yang, was\ndefeated and taken prisoner. See _Chiu T’ang Shu_, ch. 2, fol. 5 verso,\nand also ch. 54.]\n\n12. If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy, and the\nstrength of the two armies is equal, it is not easy to provoke a\nbattle,\n\n[The point is that we must not think of undertaking a long and\nwearisome march, at the end of which, as Tu Yu says, \"we should be\nexhausted and our adversary fresh and keen.\"]\n\nand fighting will be to your disadvantage.\n\n13. These six are the principles connected with Earth.\n\n[Or perhaps, \"the principles relating to ground.\" See, however, I. §\n8.]\n\nThe general who has attained a responsible post must be careful to\nstudy them.\n\n14. Now an army is exposed to six several calamities, not arising from\nnatural causes, but from faults for which the general is responsible.\nThese are: (1) Flight; (2) insubordination; (3) collapse; (4) ruin; (5)\ndisorganisation; (6) rout.",
      "15. Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled against\nanother ten times its size, the result will be the _flight_ of the\nformer.\n\n16. When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too\nweak, the result is _insubordination_.\n\n[Tu Mu cites the unhappy case of T’ien Pu [_Hsin T’ang Shu_, ch. 148],\nwho was sent to Wei in 821 A.D. with orders to lead an army against\nWang T’ing-ts’ou. But the whole time he was in command, his soldiers\ntreated him with the utmost contempt, and openly flouted his authority\nby riding about the camp on donkeys, several thousands at a time. T’ien\nPu was powerless to put a stop to this conduct, and when, after some\nmonths had passed, he made an attempt to engage the enemy, his troops\nturned tail and dispersed in every direction. After that, the\nunfortunate man committed suicide by cutting his throat.]\n\nWhen the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak, the\nresult is _collapse_.\n\n[Ts’ao Kung says: \"The officers are energetic and want to press on, the\ncommon soldiers are feeble and suddenly collapse.\"]\n\n17. When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate, and on\nmeeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of\nresentment, before the commander-in-chief can tell whether or no he is\nin a position to fight, the result is _ruin_.",
      "[Wang Hsi’s note is: \"This means, the general is angry without cause,\nand at the same time does not appreciate the ability of his subordinate\nofficers; thus he arouses fierce resentment and brings an avalanche of\nruin upon his head.\"]\n\n18. When the general is weak and without authority; when his orders are\nnot clear and distinct;\n\n[Wei Liao Tzŭ (ch. 4) says: \"If the commander gives his orders with\ndecision, the soldiers will not wait to hear them twice; if his moves\nare made without vacillation, the soldiers will not be in two minds\nabout doing their duty.\" General Baden-Powell says, italicizing the\nwords: \"The secret of getting successful work out of your trained men\nlies in one nutshell—in the clearness of the instructions they\nreceive.\" [3] Cf. also Wu Tzŭ ch. 3: \"the most fatal defect in a\nmilitary leader is difference; the worst calamities that befall an army\narise from hesitation.\"]\n\nwhen there are no fixed duties assigned to officers and men,\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"Neither officers nor men have any regular routine.\"]\n\nand the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner, the result is\nutter _disorganisation_.\n\n19. When a general, unable to estimate the enemy’s strength, allows an\ninferior force to engage a larger one, or hurls a weak detachment\nagainst a powerful one, and neglects to place picked soldiers in the\nfront rank, the result must be a _rout_.",
      "[Chang Yu paraphrases the latter part of the sentence and continues:\n\"Whenever there is fighting to be done, the keenest spirits should be\nappointed to serve in the front ranks, both in order to strengthen the\nresolution of our own men and to demoralize the enemy.\" Cf. the primi\nordines of Caesar (\"De Bello Gallico,\" V. 28, 44, et al.).]\n\n20. These are six ways of courting defeat, which must be carefully\nnoted by the general who has attained a responsible post.\n\n[See _supra_, § 13.]\n\n21. The natural formation of the country is the soldier’s best ally;\n\n[Ch’en Hao says: \"The advantages of weather and season are not equal to\nthose connected with ground.\"]\n\nbut a power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the forces of\nvictory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and\ndistances, constitutes the test of a great general.\n\n22. He who knows these things, and in fighting puts his knowledge into\npractice, will win his battles. He who knows them not, nor practises\nthem, will surely be defeated.\n\n23. If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even\nthough the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory,\nthen you must not fight even at the ruler’s bidding.",
      "[Cf. VIII. § 3 fin. Huang Shih-kung of the Ch’in dynasty, who is said\nto have been the patron of Chang Liang and to have written the _San\nLueh_, has these words attributed to him: \"The responsibility of\nsetting an army in motion must devolve on the general alone; if advance\nand retreat are controlled from the Palace, brilliant results will\nhardly be achieved. Hence the god-like ruler and the enlightened\nmonarch are content to play a humble part in furthering their country’s\ncause [lit., kneel down to push the chariot wheel].\" This means that\n\"in matters lying outside the zenana, the decision of the military\ncommander must be absolute.\" Chang Yu also quote the saying: \"Decrees\nfrom the Son of Heaven do not penetrate the walls of a camp.\"]\n\n24. The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without\nfearing disgrace,\n\n[It was Wellington, I think, who said that the hardest thing of all for\na soldier is to retreat.]\n\nwhose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for\nhis sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.\n\n[A noble presentiment, in few words, of the Chinese \"happy warrior.\"\nSuch a man, says Ho Shih, \"even if he had to suffer punishment, would\nnot regret his conduct.\"]\n\n25. Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you\ninto the deepest valleys; look on them as your own beloved sons, and\nthey will stand by you even unto death.",
      "[Cf. I. § 6. In this connection, Tu Mu draws for us an engaging picture\nof the famous general Wu Ch’i, from whose treatise on war I have\nfrequently had occasion to quote: \"He wore the same clothes and ate the\nsame food as the meanest of his soldiers, refused to have either a\nhorse to ride or a mat to sleep on, carried his own surplus rations\nwrapped in a parcel, and shared every hardship with his men. One of his\nsoldiers was suffering from an abscess, and Wu Ch’i himself sucked out\nthe virus. The soldier’s mother, hearing this, began wailing and\nlamenting. Somebody asked her, saying: ‘Why do you cry? Your son is\nonly a common soldier, and yet the commander-in-chief himself has\nsucked the poison from his sore.’ The woman replied, ‘Many years ago,\nLord Wu performed a similar service for my husband, who never left him\nafterwards, and finally met his death at the hands of the enemy. And\nnow that he has done the same for my son, he too will fall fighting I\nknow not where.’\" Li Ch’uan mentions the Viscount of Ch’u, who invaded\nthe small state of Hsiao during the winter. The Duke of Shen said to\nhim: \"Many of the soldiers are suffering severely from the cold.\" So he\nmade a round of the whole army, comforting and encouraging the men; and\nstraightway they felt as if they were clothed in garments lined with\nfloss silk.]",
      "26. If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your authority\nfelt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands; and incapable,\nmoreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened to\nspoilt children; they are useless for any practical purpose.\n\n[Li Ching once said that if you could make your soldiers afraid of you,\nthey would not be afraid of the enemy. Tu Mu recalls an instance of\nstern military discipline which occurred in 219 A.D., when Lu Meng was\noccupying the town of Chiang-ling. He had given stringent orders to his\narmy not to molest the inhabitants nor take anything from them by\nforce. Nevertheless, a certain officer serving under his banner, who\nhappened to be a fellow-townsman, ventured to appropriate a bamboo hat\nbelonging to one of the people, in order to wear it over his regulation\nhelmet as a protection against the rain. Lu Meng considered that the\nfact of his being also a native of Ju-nan should not be allowed to\npalliate a clear breach of discipline, and accordingly he ordered his\nsummary execution, the tears rolling down his face, however, as he did\nso. This act of severity filled the army with wholesome awe, and from\nthat time forth even articles dropped in the highway were not picked\nup.]",
      "27. If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are\nunaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway\ntowards victory.\n\n[That is, Ts’ao Kung says, \"the issue in this case is uncertain.\"]\n\n28. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are unaware that\nour own men are not in a condition to attack, we have gone only halfway\ntowards victory.\n\n[Cf. III. § 13 (1).]\n\n29. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also know that our\nmen are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the nature of\nthe ground makes fighting impracticable, we have still gone only\nhalfway towards victory.\n\n30. Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered;\nonce he has broken camp, he is never at a loss.\n\n[The reason being, according to Tu Mu, that he has taken his measures\nso thoroughly as to ensure victory beforehand. \"He does not move\nrecklessly,\" says Chang Yu, \"so that when he does move, he makes no\nmistakes.\"]\n\n31. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your\nvictory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you\nmay make your victory complete.\n\n[Li Ch’uan sums up as follows: \"Given a knowledge of three things—the\naffairs of men, the seasons of heaven and the natural advantages of\nearth—, victory will invariably crown your battles.\"]\n\n[1] See \"Pensees de Napoleon 1er,\" no. 47.",
      "[2] \"The Science of War,\" chap. 2.\n\n[3] \"Aids to Scouting,\" p. xii.\n\nChapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n1. Sun Tzŭ said: The art of war recognises nine varieties of ground:\n(1) Dispersive ground; (2) facile ground; (3) contentious ground; (4)\nopen ground; (5) ground of intersecting highways; (6) serious ground;\n(7) difficult ground; (8) hemmed-in ground; (9) desperate ground.\n\n2. When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory, it is dispersive\nground.\n\n[So called because the soldiers, being near to their homes and anxious\nto see their wives and children, are likely to seize the opportunity\nafforded by a battle and scatter in every direction. \"In their\nadvance,\" observes Tu Mu, \"they will lack the valor of desperation, and\nwhen they retreat, they will find harbors of refuge.\"]\n\n3. When he has penetrated into hostile territory, but to no great\ndistance, it is facile ground.\n\n[Li Ch’uan and Ho Shih say \"because of the facility for retreating,\"\nand the other commentators give similar explanations. Tu Mu remarks:\n\"When your army has crossed the border, you should burn your boats and\nbridges, in order to make it clear to everybody that you have no\nhankering after home.\"]\n\n4. Ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either\nside, is contentious ground.",
      "[Tu Mu defines the ground as ground \"to be contended for.\" Ts’ao Kung\nsays: \"ground on which the few and the weak can defeat the many and the\nstrong,\" such as \"the neck of a pass,\" instanced by Li Ch’uan. Thus,\nThermopylae was of this classification because the possession of it,\neven for a few days only, meant holding the entire invading army in\ncheck and thus gaining invaluable time. Cf. Wu Tzŭ, ch. V. ad init.:\n\"For those who have to fight in the ratio of one to ten, there is\nnothing better than a narrow pass.\" When Lu Kuang was returning from\nhis triumphant expedition to Turkestan in 385 A.D., and had got as far\nas I-ho, laden with spoils, Liang Hsi, administrator of Liang-chou,\ntaking advantage of the death of Fu Chien, King of Ch’in, plotted\nagainst him and was for barring his way into the province. Yang Han,\ngovernor of Kao-ch’ang, counseled him, saying: \"Lu Kuang is fresh from\nhis victories in the west, and his soldiers are vigorous and\nmettlesome. If we oppose him in the shifting sands of the desert, we\nshall be no match for him, and we must therefore try a different plan.\nLet us hasten to occupy the defile at the mouth of the Kao-wu pass,\nthus cutting him off from supplies of water, and when his troops are\nprostrated with thirst, we can dictate our own terms without moving. Or\nif you think that the pass I mention is too far off, we could make a\nstand against him at the I-wu pass, which is nearer. The cunning and\nresource of Tzŭ-fang himself would be expended in vain against the\nenormous strength of these two positions.\" Liang Hsi, refusing to act\non this advice, was overwhelmed and swept away by the invader.]",
      "5. Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground.\n\n[There are various interpretations of the Chinese adjective for this\ntype of ground. Ts’ao Kung says it means \"ground covered with a network\nof roads,\" like a chessboard. Ho Shih suggested: \"ground on which\nintercommunication is easy.\"]\n\n6. Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states,\n\n[Ts’au Kung defines this as: \"Our country adjoining the enemy’s and a\nthird country conterminous with both.\" Meng Shih instances the small\nprincipality of Cheng, which was bounded on the north-east by Ch’i, on\nthe west by Chin, and on the south by Ch’u.]\n\nso that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire at his command,\n\n[The belligerent who holds this dominating position can constrain most\nof them to become his allies.]\n\nis ground of intersecting highways.\n\n7. When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country,\nleaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground.\n\n[Wang Hsi explains the name by saying that \"when an army has reached\nsuch a point, its situation is serious.\"]\n\n8. Mountain forests,\n\n[Or simply \"forests.\"]\n\nrugged steeps, marshes and fens—all country that is hard to traverse:\nthis is difficult ground.",
      "9. Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can\nonly retire by tortuous paths, so that a small number of the enemy\nwould suffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed in\nground.\n\n10. Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting\nwithout delay, is desperate ground.",
      "[The situation, as pictured by Ts’ao Kung, is very similar to the\n\"hemmed-in ground\" except that here escape is no longer possible: \"A\nlofty mountain in front, a large river behind, advance impossible,\nretreat blocked.\" Ch’en Hao says: \"to be on ‘desperate ground’ is like\nsitting in a leaking boat or crouching in a burning house.\" Tu Mu\nquotes from Li Ching a vivid description of the plight of an army thus\nentrapped: \"Suppose an army invading hostile territory without the aid\nof local guides:—it falls into a fatal snare and is at the enemy’s\nmercy. A ravine on the left, a mountain on the right, a pathway so\nperilous that the horses have to be roped together and the chariots\ncarried in slings, no passage open in front, retreat cut off behind, no\nchoice but to proceed in single file. Then, before there is time to\nrange our soldiers in order of battle, the enemy is overwhelming\nstrength suddenly appears on the scene. Advancing, we can nowhere take\na breathing-space; retreating, we have no haven of refuge. We seek a\npitched battle, but in vain; yet standing on the defensive, none of us\nhas a moment’s respite. If we simply maintain our ground, whole days\nand months will crawl by; the moment we make a move, we have to sustain\nthe enemy’s attacks on front and rear. The country is wild, destitute\nof water and plants; the army is lacking in the necessaries of life,\nthe horses are jaded and the men worn-out, all the resources of\nstrength and skill unavailing, the pass so narrow that a single man\ndefending it can check the onset of ten thousand; all means of offense\nin the hands of the enemy, all points of vantage already forfeited by\nourselves:—in this terrible plight, even though we had the most valiant\nsoldiers and the keenest of weapons, how could they be employed with\nthe slightest effect?\" Students of Greek history may be reminded of the\nawful close to the Sicilian expedition, and the agony of the Athenians\nunder Nicias and Demonsthenes. [See Thucydides, VII. 78 sqq.].]",
      "11. On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not. On facile ground, halt\nnot. On contentious ground, attack not.\n\n[But rather let all your energies be bent on occupying the advantageous\nposition first. So Ts’ao Kung. Li Ch’uan and others, however, suppose\nthe meaning to be that the enemy has already forestalled us, sot that\nit would be sheer madness to attack. In the _Sun Tzŭ Hsu Lu_, when the\nKing of Wu inquires what should be done in this case, Sun Tzŭ replies:\n\"The rule with regard to contentious ground is that those in possession\nhave the advantage over the other side. If a position of this kind is\nsecured first by the enemy, beware of attacking him. Lure him away by\npretending to flee—show your banners and sound your drums—make a dash\nfor other places that he cannot afford to lose—trail brushwood and\nraise a dust—confound his ears and eyes—detach a body of your best\ntroops, and place it secretly in ambuscade. Then your opponent will\nsally forth to the rescue.\"]\n\n12. On open ground, do not try to block the enemy’s way.\n\n[Because the attempt would be futile, and would expose the blocking\nforce itself to serious risks. There are two interpretations available\nhere. I follow that of Chang Yu. The other is indicated in Ts’ao Kung’s\nbrief note: \"Draw closer together\"—i.e., see that a portion of your own\narmy is not cut off.]",
      "On ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your allies.\n\n[Or perhaps, \"form alliances with neighbouring states.\"]\n\n13. On serious ground, gather in plunder.\n\n[On this, Li Ch’uan has the following delicious note: \"When an army\npenetrates far into the enemy’s country, care must be taken not to\nalienate the people by unjust treatment. Follow the example of the Han\nEmperor Kao Tsu, whose march into Ch’in territory was marked by no\nviolation of women or looting of valuables. [Nota bene: this was in 207\nB.C., and may well cause us to blush for the Christian armies that\nentered Peking in 1900 A.D.] Thus he won the hearts of all. In the\npresent passage, then, I think that the true reading must be, not\n‘plunder,’ but ‘do not plunder.’\" Alas, I fear that in this instance\nthe worthy commentator’s feelings outran his judgment. Tu Mu, at least,\nhas no such illusions. He says: \"When encamped on ‘serious ground,’\nthere being no inducement as yet to advance further, and no possibility\nof retreat, one ought to take measures for a protracted resistance by\nbringing in provisions from all sides, and keep a close watch on the\nenemy.\"]\n\nIn difficult ground, keep steadily on the march.\n\n[Or, in the words of VIII. § 2, \"do not encamp.]\n\n14. On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem.",
      "[Ts’au Kung says: \"Try the effect of some unusual artifice;\" and Tu Yu\namplifies this by saying: \"In such a position, some scheme must be\ndevised which will suit the circumstances, and if we can succeed in\ndeluding the enemy, the peril may be escaped.\" This is exactly what\nhappened on the famous occasion when Hannibal was hemmed in among the\nmountains on the road to Casilinum, and to all appearances entrapped by\nthe dictator Fabius. The stratagem which Hannibal devised to baffle his\nfoes was remarkably like that which T’ien Tan had also employed with\nsuccess exactly 62 years before. [See IX. § 24, note.] When night came\non, bundles of twigs were fastened to the horns of some 2000 oxen and\nset on fire, the terrified animals being then quickly driven along the\nmountain side towards the passes which were beset by the enemy. The\nstrange spectacle of these rapidly moving lights so alarmed and\ndiscomfited the Romans that they withdrew from their position, and\nHannibal’s army passed safely through the defile. [See Polybius, III.\n93, 94; Livy, XXII. 16 17.]\n\nOn desperate ground, fight.\n\n[For, as Chia Lin remarks: \"if you fight with all your might, there is\na chance of life; where as death is certain if you cling to your\ncorner.\"]\n\n15. Those who were called skilful leaders of old knew how to drive a\nwedge between the enemy’s front and rear;",
      "[More literally, \"cause the front and rear to lose touch with each\nother.\"]\n\nto prevent co-operation between his large and small divisions; to\nhinder the good troops from rescuing the bad, the officers from\nrallying their men.\n\n16. When the enemy’s men were scattered, they prevented them from\nconcentrating; even when their forces were united, they managed to keep\nthem in disorder.\n\n17. When it was to their advantage, they made a forward move; when\notherwise, they stopped still.\n\n[Mei Yao-ch’en connects this with the foregoing: \"Having succeeded in\nthus dislocating the enemy, they would push forward in order to secure\nany advantage to be gained; if there was no advantage to be gained,\nthey would remain where they were.\"]\n\n18. If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly\narray and on the point of marching to the attack, I should say: \"Begin\nby seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be\namenable to your will.\"",
      "[Opinions differ as to what Sun Tzŭ had in mind. Ts’ao Kung thinks it\nis \"some strategical advantage on which the enemy is depending.\" Tu Mu\nsays: \"The three things which an enemy is anxious to do, and on the\naccomplishment of which his success depends, are: (1) to capture our\nfavourable positions; (2) to ravage our cultivated land; (3) to guard\nhis own communications.\" Our object then must be to thwart his plans in\nthese three directions and thus render him helpless. [Cf. III. § 3.] By\nboldly seizing the initiative in this way, you at once throw the other\nside on the defensive.]\n\n19. Rapidity is the essence of war:",
      "[According to Tu Mu, \"this is a summary of leading principles in\nwarfare,\" and he adds: \"These are the profoundest truths of military\nscience, and the chief business of the general.\" The following\nanecdotes, told by Ho Shih, shows the importance attached to speed by\ntwo of China’s greatest generals. In 227 A.D., Meng Ta, governor of\nHsin-ch’eng under the Wei Emperor Wen Ti, was meditating defection to\nthe House of Shu, and had entered into correspondence with Chu-ko\nLiang, Prime Minister of that State. The Wei general Ssu-ma I was then\nmilitary governor of Wan, and getting wind of Meng Ta’s treachery, he\nat once set off with an army to anticipate his revolt, having\npreviously cajoled him by a specious message of friendly import.\nSsu-ma’s officers came to him and said: \"If Meng Ta has leagued himself\nwith Wu and Shu, the matter should be thoroughly investigated before we\nmake a move.\" Ssu-ma I replied: \"Meng Ta is an unprincipled man, and we\nought to go and punish him at once, while he is still wavering and\nbefore he has thrown off the mask.\" Then, by a series of forced\nmarches, be brought his army under the walls of Hsin-ch’eng with in a\nspace of eight days. Now Meng Ta had previously said in a letter to\nChu-ko Liang: \"Wan is 1200 _li_ from here. When the news of my revolt\nreaches Ssu-ma I, he will at once inform his imperial master, but it\nwill be a whole month before any steps can be taken, and by that time\nmy city will be well fortified. Besides, Ssu-ma I is sure not to come\nhimself, and the generals that will be sent against us are not worth\ntroubling about.\" The next letter, however, was filled with\nconsternation: \"Though only eight days have passed since I threw off my\nallegiance, an army is already at the city-gates. What miraculous\nrapidity is this!\" A fortnight later, Hsin- ch’eng had fallen and Meng\nTa had lost his head. [See _Chin Shu_, ch. 1, f. 3.] In 621 A.D., Li\nChing was sent from K’uei-chou in Ssu-ch’uan to reduce the successful\nrebel Hsiao Hsien, who had set up as Emperor at the modern Ching-chou\nFu in Hupeh. It was autumn, and the Yangtsze being then in flood, Hsiao\nHsien never dreamt that his adversary would venture to come down\nthrough the gorges, and consequently made no preparations. But Li Ching\nembarked his army without loss of time, and was just about to start\nwhen the other generals implored him to postpone his departure until\nthe river was in a less dangerous state for navigation. Li Ching\nreplied: \"To the soldier, overwhelming speed is of paramount\nimportance, and he must never miss opportunities. Now is the time to\nstrike, before Hsiao Hsien even knows that we have got an army\ntogether. If we seize the present moment when the river is in flood, we\nshall appear before his capital with startling suddenness, like the\nthunder which is heard before you have time to stop your ears against\nit. [See VII. § 19, note.] This is the great principle in war. Even if\nhe gets to know of our approach, he will have to levy his soldiers in\nsuch a hurry that they will not be fit to oppose us. Thus the full\nfruits of victory will be ours.\" All came about as he predicted, and\nHsiao Hsien was obliged to surrender, nobly stipulating that his people\nshould be spared and he alone suffer the penalty of death.]",
      "take advantage of the enemy’s unreadiness, make your way by unexpected\nroutes, and attack unguarded spots.\n\n20. The following are the principles to be observed by an invading\nforce: The further you penetrate into a country, the greater will be\nthe solidarity of your troops, and thus the defenders will not prevail\nagainst you.\n\n21. Make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with\nfood.\n\n[Cf. _supra_, § 13. Li Ch’uan does not venture on a note here.]\n\n22. Carefully study the well-being of your men,\n\n[For \"well-being\", Wang Hsi means, \"Pet them, humor them, give them\nplenty of food and drink, and look after them generally.\"]\n\nand do not overtax them. Concentrate your energy and hoard your\nstrength.",
      "[Ch’en recalls the line of action adopted in 224 B.C. by the famous\ngeneral Wang Chien, whose military genius largely contributed to the\nsuccess of the First Emperor. He had invaded the Ch’u State, where a\nuniversal levy was made to oppose him. But, being doubtful of the\ntemper of his troops, he declined all invitations to fight and remained\nstrictly on the defensive. In vain did the Ch’u general try to force a\nbattle: day after day Wang Chien kept inside his walls and would not\ncome out, but devoted his whole time and energy to winning the\naffection and confidence of his men. He took care that they should be\nwell fed, sharing his own meals with them, provided facilities for\nbathing, and employed every method of judicious indulgence to weld them\ninto a loyal and homogenous body. After some time had elapsed, he told\noff certain persons to find out how the men were amusing themselves.\nThe answer was, that they were contending with one another in putting\nthe weight and long-jumping. When Wang Chien heard that they were\nengaged in these athletic pursuits, he knew that their spirits had been\nstrung up to the required pitch and that they were now ready for\nfighting. By this time the Ch’u army, after repeating their challenge\nagain and again, had marched away eastwards in disgust. The Ch’in\ngeneral immediately broke up his camp and followed them, and in the\nbattle that ensued they were routed with great slaughter. Shortly\nafterwards, the whole of Ch’u was conquered by Ch’in, and the king\nFu-ch’u led into captivity.]",
      "Keep your army continually on the move,\n\n[In order that the enemy may never know exactly where you are. It has\nstruck me, however, that the true reading might be \"link your army\ntogether.\"]\n\nand devise unfathomable plans.\n\n23. Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and\nthey will prefer death to flight. If they will face death, there is\nnothing they may not achieve.\n\n[Chang Yu quotes his favourite Wei Liao Tzŭ (ch. 3): \"If one man were to\nrun amok with a sword in the market-place, and everybody else tried to\nget our of his way, I should not allow that this man alone had courage\nand that all the rest were contemptible cowards. The truth is, that a\ndesperado and a man who sets some value on his life do not meet on even\nterms.\"]\n\nOfficers and men alike will put forth their uttermost strength.\n\n[Chang Yu says: \"If they are in an awkward place together, they will\nsurely exert their united strength to get out of it.\"]\n\n24. Soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear. If there\nis no place of refuge, they will stand firm. If they are in the heart\nof a hostile country, they will show a stubborn front. If there is no\nhelp for it, they will fight hard.\n\n25. Thus, without waiting to be marshalled, the soldiers will be\nconstantly on the _qui vive;_ without waiting to be asked, they will do\nyour will;\n\n[Literally, \"without asking, you will get.\"]",
      "without restrictions, they will be faithful; without giving orders,\nthey can be trusted.\n\n26. Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious\ndoubts. Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared.\n\n[The superstitious, \"bound in to saucy doubts and fears,\" degenerate\ninto cowards and \"die many times before their deaths.\" Tu Mu quotes\nHuang Shih-kung: \"‘Spells and incantations should be strictly\nforbidden, and no officer allowed to inquire by divination into the\nfortunes of an army, for fear the soldiers’ minds should be seriously\nperturbed.’ The meaning is,\" he continues, \"that if all doubts and\nscruples are discarded, your men will never falter in their resolution\nuntil they die.\"]\n\n27. If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because\nthey have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it\nis not because they are disinclined to longevity.\n\n[Chang Yu has the best note on this passage: \"Wealth and long life are\nthings for which all men have a natural inclination. Hence, if they\nburn or fling away valuables, and sacrifice their own lives, it is not\nthat they dislike them, but simply that they have no choice.\" Sun Tzŭ\nis slyly insinuating that, as soldiers are but human, it is for the\ngeneral to see that temptations to shirk fighting and grow rich are not\nthrown in their way.]",
      "28. On the day they are ordered out to battle, your soldiers may weep,\n\n[The word in the Chinese is \"snivel.\" This is taken to indicate more\ngenuine grief than tears alone.]\n\nthose sitting up bedewing their garments, and those lying down letting\nthe tears run down their cheeks.\n\n[Not because they are afraid, but because, as Ts’ao Kung says, \"all\nhave embraced the firm resolution to do or die.\" We may remember that\nthe heroes of the Iliad were equally childlike in showing their\nemotion. Chang Yu alludes to the mournful parting at the I River\nbetween Ching K’o and his friends, when the former was sent to attempt\nthe life of the King of Ch’in (afterwards First Emperor) in 227 B.C.\nThe tears of all flowed down like rain as he bade them farewell and\nuttered the following lines: \"The shrill blast is blowing, Chilly the\nburn; Your champion is going—Not to return.\" [1] ]\n\nBut let them once be brought to bay, and they will display the courage\nof a Chu or a Kuei.",
      "[Chu was the personal name of Chuan Chu, a native of the Wu State and\ncontemporary with Sun Tzŭ himself, who was employed by Kung-tzu Kuang,\nbetter known as Ho Lu Wang, to assassinate his sovereign Wang Liao with\na dagger which he secreted in the belly of a fish served up at a\nbanquet. He succeeded in his attempt, but was immediately hacked to\npieces by the king’s bodyguard. This was in 515 B.C. The other hero\nreferred to, Ts’ao Kuei (or Ts’ao Mo), performed the exploit which has\nmade his name famous 166 years earlier, in 681 B.C. Lu had been thrice\ndefeated by Ch’i, and was just about to conclude a treaty surrendering\na large slice of territory, when Ts’ao Kuei suddenly seized Huan Kung,\nthe Duke of Ch’i, as he stood on the altar steps and held a dagger\nagainst his chest. None of the duke’s retainers dared to move a muscle,\nand Ts’ao Kuei proceeded to demand full restitution, declaring the Lu\nwas being unjustly treated because she was a smaller and a weaker\nstate. Huan Kung, in peril of his life, was obliged to consent,\nwhereupon Ts’ao Kuei flung away his dagger and quietly resumed his\nplace amid the terrified assemblage without having so much as changed\ncolor. As was to be expected, the Duke wanted afterwards to repudiate\nthe bargain, but his wise old counselor Kuan Chung pointed out to him\nthe impolicy of breaking his word, and the upshot was that this bold\nstroke regained for Lu the whole of what she had lost in three pitched\nbattles.]",
      "29. The skilful tactician may be likened to the _shuai-jan_. Now the\n_shuai-jan_ is a snake that is found in the Ch‘ang mountains.\n\n[\"_Shuai-jan_\" means \"suddenly\" or \"rapidly,\" and the snake in question\nwas doubtless so called owing to the rapidity of its movements. Through\nthis passage, the term in the Chinese has now come to be used in the\nsense of \"military manœuvers.\"]\n\nStrike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its\ntail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and\nyou will be attacked by head and tail both.\n\n30. Asked if an army can be made to imitate the _shuai-jan_,\n\n[That is, as Mei Yao-ch’en says, \"Is it possible to make the front and\nrear of an army each swiftly responsive to attack on the other, just as\nthough they were part of a single living body?\"]\n\nI should answer, Yes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yüeh are\nenemies;\n\n[Cf. VI. § 21.]\n\nyet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a\nstorm, they will come to each other’s assistance just as the left hand\nhelps the right.\n\n[The meaning is: If two enemies will help each other in a time of\ncommon peril, how much more should two parts of the same army, bound\ntogether as they are by every tie of interest and fellow-feeling. Yet\nit is notorious that many a campaign has been ruined through lack of\ncooperation, especially in the case of allied armies.]",
      "31. Hence it is not enough to put one’s trust in the tethering of\nhorses, and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground.\n\n[These quaint devices to prevent one’s army from running away recall\nthe Athenian hero Sophanes, who carried the anchor with him at the\nbattle of Plataea, by means of which he fastened himself firmly to one\nspot. [See Herodotus, IX. 74.] It is not enough, says Sun Tzŭ, to\nrender flight impossible by such mechanical means. You will not succeed\nunless your men have tenacity and unity of purpose, and, above all, a\nspirit of sympathetic cooperation. This is the lesson which can be\nlearned from the _shuai-jan_.]\n\n32. The principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard\nof courage which all must reach.\n\n[Literally, \"level the courage [of all] as though [it were that of]\none.\" If the ideal army is to form a single organic whole, then it\nfollows that the resolution and spirit of its component parts must be\nof the same quality, or at any rate must not fall below a certain\nstandard. Wellington’s seemingly ungrateful description of his army at\nWaterloo as \"the worst he had ever commanded\" meant no more than that\nit was deficient in this important particular—unity of spirit and\ncourage. Had he not foreseen the Belgian defections and carefully kept\nthose troops in the background, he would almost certainly have lost the\nday.]",
      "33. How to make the best of both strong and weak—that is a question\ninvolving the proper use of ground.\n\n[Mei Yao-ch’en’s paraphrase is: \"The way to eliminate the differences\nof strong and weak and to make both serviceable is to utilize\naccidental features of the ground.\" Less reliable troops, if posted in\nstrong positions, will hold out as long as better troops on more\nexposed terrain. The advantage of position neutralizes the inferiority\nin stamina and courage. Col. Henderson says: \"With all respect to the\ntext books, and to the ordinary tactical teaching, I am inclined to\nthink that the study of ground is often overlooked, and that by no\nmeans sufficient importance is attached to the selection of positions…\nand to the immense advantages that are to be derived, whether you are\ndefending or attacking, from the proper utilization of natural\nfeatures.\" [2] ]\n\n34. Thus the skilful general conducts his army just as though he were\nleading a single man, willy-nilly, by the hand.\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"The simile has reference to the ease with which he does\nit.\"]\n\n35. It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure\nsecrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order.\n\n36. He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports\nand appearances,\n\n[Literally, \"to deceive their eyes and ears.\"]\n\nand thus keep them in total ignorance.",
      "[Ts’ao Kung gives us one of his excellent apophthegms: \"The troops must\nnot be allowed to share your schemes in the beginning; they may only\nrejoice with you over their happy outcome.\" \"To mystify, mislead, and\nsurprise the enemy,\" is one of the first principles in war, as had been\nfrequently pointed out. But how about the other process—the\nmystification of one’s own men? Those who may think that Sun Tzŭ is\nover-emphatic on this point would do well to read Col. Henderson’s\nremarks on Stonewall Jackson’s Valley campaign: \"The infinite pains,\"\nhe says, \"with which Jackson sought to conceal, even from his most\ntrusted staff officers, his movements, his intentions, and his\nthoughts, a commander less thorough would have pronounced useless\"—etc.\netc. [3] In the year 88 A.D., as we read in ch. 47 of the _Hou Han\nShu_, \"Pan Ch’ao took the field with 25,000 men from Khotan and other\nCentral Asian states with the object of crushing Yarkand. The King of\nKutcha replied by dispatching his chief commander to succour the place\nwith an army drawn from the kingdoms of Wen-su, Ku-mo, and Wei-t’ou,\ntotaling 50,000 men. Pan Ch’ao summoned his officers and also the King\nof Khotan to a council of war, and said: ‘Our forces are now\noutnumbered and unable to make head against the enemy. The best plan,\nthen, is for us to separate and disperse, each in a different\ndirection. The King of Khotan will march away by the easterly route,\nand I will then return myself towards the west. Let us wait until the\nevening drum has sounded and then start.’ Pan Ch’ao now secretly\nreleased the prisoners whom he had taken alive, and the King of Kutcha\nwas thus informed of his plans. Much elated by the news, the latter set\noff at once at the head of 10,000 horsemen to bar Pan Ch’ao’s retreat\nin the west, while the King of Wen-su rode eastward with 8000 horse in\norder to intercept the King of Khotan. As soon as Pan Ch’ao knew that\nthe two chieftains had gone, he called his divisions together, got them\nwell in hand, and at cock-crow hurled them against the army of Yarkand,\nas it lay encamped. The barbarians, panic-stricken, fled in confusion,\nand were closely pursued by Pan Ch’ao. Over 5000 heads were brought\nback as trophies, besides immense spoils in the shape of horses and\ncattle and valuables of every description. Yarkand then capitulating,\nKutcha and the other kingdoms drew off their respective forces. From\nthat time forward, Pan Ch’ao’s prestige completely overawed the\ncountries of the west.\" In this case, we see that the Chinese general\nnot only kept his own officers in ignorance of his real plans, but\nactually took the bold step of dividing his army in order to deceive\nthe enemy.]",
      "37. By altering his arrangements and changing his plans,\n\n[Wang Hsi thinks that this means not using the same stratagem twice.]\n\nhe keeps the enemy without definite knowledge.\n\n[Chang Yu, in a quotation from another work, says: \"The axiom, that war\nis based on deception, does not apply only to deception of the enemy.\nYou must deceive even your own soldiers. Make them follow you, but\nwithout letting them know why.\"]\n\nBy shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes, he prevents the\nenemy from anticipating his purpose.\n\n38. At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like one who has\nclimbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him. He\ncarries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand.\n\n[Literally, \"releases the spring\" (see V. § 15), that is, takes some\ndecisive step which makes it impossible for the army to return—like\nHsiang Yu, who sunk his ships after crossing a river. Ch’en Hao,\nfollowed by Chia Lin, understands the words less well as \"puts forth\nevery artifice at his command.\"]\n\n39. He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like a shepherd\ndriving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that, and\nnone knows whither he is going.\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"The army is only cognizant of orders to advance or\nretreat; it is ignorant of the ulterior ends of attacking and\nconquering.\"]",
      "40. To muster his host and bring it into danger:—this may be termed the\nbusiness of the general.\n\n[Sun Tzŭ means that after mobilization there should be no delay in\naiming a blow at the enemy’s heart. Note how he returns again and again\nto this point. Among the warring states of ancient China, desertion was\nno doubt a much more present fear and serious evil than it is in the\narmies of today.]\n\n41. The different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground;\n\n[Chang Yu says: \"One must not be hide-bound in interpreting the rules\nfor the nine varieties of ground.\"]\n\nthe expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics; and the fundamental\nlaws of human nature: these are things that must most certainly be\nstudied.\n\n42. When invading hostile territory, the general principle is, that\npenetrating deeply brings cohesion; penetrating but a short way means\ndispersion.\n\n[Cf. _supra_, § 20.]\n\n43. When you leave your own country behind, and take your army across\nneighbourhood territory, you find yourself on critical ground.",
      "[This \"ground\" is curiously mentioned in VIII. § 2, but it does not\nfigure among the Nine Situations or the Six Calamities in chap. X.\nOne’s first impulse would be to translate it distant ground,\" but this,\nif we can trust the commentators, is precisely what is not meant here.\nMei Yao-ch’en says it is \"a position not far enough advanced to be\ncalled ‘facile,’ and not near enough to home to be ‘dispersive,’ but\nsomething between the two.\" Wang Hsi says: \"It is ground separated from\nhome by an interjacent state, whose territory we have had to cross in\norder to reach it. Hence, it is incumbent on us to settle our business\nthere quickly.\" He adds that this position is of rare occurrence, which\nis the reason why it is not included among the Nine Situations.]\n\nWhen there are means of communication on all four sides, the ground is\none of intersecting highways.\n\n44. When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is serious ground.\nWhen you penetrate but a little way, it is facile ground.\n\n45. When you have the enemy’s strongholds on your rear, and narrow\npasses in front, it is hemmed-in ground. When there is no place of\nrefuge at all, it is desperate ground.\n\n46. Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men with unity\nof purpose.\n\n[This end, according to Tu Mu, is best attained by remaining on the\ndefensive, and avoiding battle. Cf. _supra_, § 11.]",
      "On facile ground, I would see that there is close connection between\nall parts of my army.\n\n[As Tu Mu says, the object is to guard against two possible\ncontingencies: \"(1) the desertion of our own troops; (2) a sudden\nattack on the part of the enemy.\" Cf. VII. § 17. Mei Yao-ch’en says:\n\"On the march, the regiments should be in close touch; in an\nencampment, there should be continuity between the fortifications.\"]\n\n47. On contentious ground, I would hurry up my rear.",
      "[This is Ts’ao Kung’s interpretation. Chang Yu adopts it, saying: \"We\nmust quickly bring up our rear, so that head and tail may both reach\nthe goal.\" That is, they must not be allowed to straggle up a long way\napart. Mei Yao-ch’en offers another equally plausible explanation:\n\"Supposing the enemy has not yet reached the coveted position, and we\nare behind him, we should advance with all speed in order to dispute\nits possession.\" Ch’en Hao, on the other hand, assuming that the enemy\nhas had time to select his own ground, quotes VI. § 1, where Sun Tzŭ\nwarns us against coming exhausted to the attack. His own idea of the\nsituation is rather vaguely expressed: \"If there is a favourable\nposition lying in front of you, detach a picked body of troops to\noccupy it, then if the enemy, relying on their numbers, come up to make\na fight for it, you may fall quickly on their rear with your main body,\nand victory will be assured.\" It was thus, he adds, that Chao She beat\nthe army of Ch’in. (See p. 57.)]\n\n48. On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye on my defences. On\nground of intersecting highways, I would consolidate my alliances.\n\n49. On serious ground, I would try to ensure a continuous stream of\nsupplies.\n\n[The commentators take this as referring to forage and plunder, not, as\none might expect, to an unbroken communication with a home base.]",
      "On difficult ground, I would keep pushing on along the road.\n\n50. On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way of retreat.\n\n[Meng Shih says: \"To make it seem that I meant to defend the position,\nwhereas my real intention is to burst suddenly through the enemy’s\nlines.\" Mei Yao-ch’en says: \"in order to make my soldiers fight with\ndesperation.\" Wang Hsi says, \"fearing lest my men be tempted to run\naway.\" Tu Mu points out that this is the converse of VII. § 36, where\nit is the enemy who is surrounded. In 532 A.D., Kao Huan, afterwards\nEmperor and canonized as Shen-wu, was surrounded by a great army under\nErh-chu Chao and others. His own force was comparatively small,\nconsisting only of 2000 horse and something under 30,000 foot. The\nlines of investment had not been drawn very closely together, gaps\nbeing left at certain points. But Kao Huan, instead of trying to\nescape, actually made a shift to block all the remaining outlets\nhimself by driving into them a number of oxen and donkeys roped\ntogether. As soon as his officers and men saw that there was nothing\nfor it but to conquer or die, their spirits rose to an extraordinary\npitch of exaltation, and they charged with such desperate ferocity that\nthe opposing ranks broke and crumbled under their onslaught.]\n\nOn desperate ground, I would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness\nof saving their lives.",
      "Tu Yu says: \"Burn your baggage and impedimenta, throw away your stores\nand provisions, choke up the wells, destroy your cooking-stoves, and\nmake it plain to your men that they cannot survive, but must fight to\nthe death.\" Mei Yao-ch’en says: \"The only chance of life lies in giving\nup all hope of it.\" This concludes what Sun Tzŭ has to say about\n\"grounds\" and the \"variations\" corresponding to them. Reviewing the\npassages which bear on this important subject, we cannot fail to be\nstruck by the desultory and unmethodical fashion in which it is\ntreated. Sun Tzŭ begins abruptly in VIII. § 2 to enumerate \"variations\"\nbefore touching on \"grounds\" at all, but only mentions five, namely\nnos. 7, 5, 8 and 9 of the subsequent list, and one that is not included\nin it. A few varieties of ground are dealt with in the earlier portion\nof chap. IX, and then chap. X sets forth six new grounds, with six\nvariations of plan to match. None of these is mentioned again, though\nthe first is hardly to be distinguished from ground no. 4 in the next\nchapter. At last, in chap. XI, we come to the Nine Grounds par\nexcellence, immediately followed by the variations. This takes us down\nto § 14. In §§ 43-45, fresh definitions are provided for nos. 5, 6, 2,\n8 and 9 (in the order given), as well as for the tenth ground noticed\nin chap. VIII; and finally, the nine variations are enumerated once\nmore from beginning to end, all, with the exception of 5, 6 and 7,\nbeing different from those previously given. Though it is impossible to\naccount for the present state of Sun Tzŭ’s text, a few suggestive facts\nmaybe brought into prominence: (1) Chap. VIII, according to the title,\nshould deal with nine variations, whereas only five appear. (2) It is\nan abnormally short chapter. (3) Chap. XI is entitled The Nine Grounds.\nSeveral of these are defined twice over, besides which there are two\ndistinct lists of the corresponding variations. (4) The length of the\nchapter is disproportionate, being double that of any other except IX.\nI do not propose to draw any inferences from these facts, beyond the\ngeneral conclusion that Sun Tzŭ’s work cannot have come down to us in\nthe shape in which it left his hands: chap. VIII is obviously defective\nand probably out of place, while XI seems to contain matter that has\neither been added by a later hand or ought to appear elsewhere.]",
      "51. For it is the soldier’s disposition to offer an obstinate\nresistance when surrounded, to fight hard when he cannot help himself,\nand to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger.",
      "[Chang Yu alludes to the conduct of Pan Ch’ao’s devoted followers in 73\nA.D. The story runs thus in the _Hou Han Shu_, ch. 47: \"When Pan Ch’ao\narrived at Shan-shan, Kuang, the King of the country, received him at\nfirst with great politeness and respect; but shortly afterwards his\nbehavior underwent a sudden change, and he became remiss and negligent.\nPan Ch’ao spoke about this to the officers of his suite: ‘Have you\nnoticed,’ he said, ‘that Kuang’s polite intentions are on the wane?\nThis must signify that envoys have come from the Northern barbarians,\nand that consequently he is in a state of indecision, not knowing with\nwhich side to throw in his lot. That surely is the reason. The truly\nwise man, we are told, can perceive things before they have come to\npass; how much more, then, those that are already manifest!’ Thereupon\nhe called one of the natives who had been assigned to his service, and\nset a trap for him, saying: ‘Where are those envoys from the Hsiung-nu\nwho arrived some day ago?’ The man was so taken aback that between\nsurprise and fear he presently blurted out the whole truth. Pan Ch’ao,\nkeeping his informant carefully under lock and key, then summoned a\ngeneral gathering of his officers, thirty-six in all, and began\ndrinking with them. When the wine had mounted into their heads a\nlittle, he tried to rouse their spirit still further by addressing them\nthus: ‘Gentlemen, here we are in the heart of an isolated region,\nanxious to achieve riches and honour by some great exploit. Now it\nhappens that an ambassador from the Hsiung-no arrived in this kingdom\nonly a few days ago, and the result is that the respectful courtesy\nextended towards us by our royal host has disappeared. Should this\nenvoy prevail upon him to seize our party and hand us over to the\nHsiung-no, our bones will become food for the wolves of the desert.\nWhat are we to do?’ With one accord, the officers replied: ‘Standing as\nwe do in peril of our lives, we will follow our commander through life\nand death.’ For the sequel of this adventure, see chap. XII. § 1,\nnote.]",
      "52. We cannot enter into alliance with neighbouring princes until we are\nacquainted with their designs. We are not fit to lead an army on the\nmarch unless we are familiar with the face of the country—its mountains\nand forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps. We\nshall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make\nuse of local guides.\n\n[These three sentences are repeated from VII. §§ 12-14—in order to\nemphasize their importance, the commentators seem to think. I prefer to\nregard them as interpolated here in order to form an antecedent to the\nfollowing words. With regard to local guides, Sun Tzŭ might have added\nthat there is always the risk of going wrong, either through their\ntreachery or some misunderstanding such as Livy records (XXII. 13):\nHannibal, we are told, ordered a guide to lead him into the\nneighbourhood of Casinum, where there was an important pass to be\noccupied; but his Carthaginian accent, unsuited to the pronunciation of\nLatin names, caused the guide to understand Casilinum instead of\nCasinum, and turning from his proper route, he took the army in that\ndirection, the mistake not being discovered until they had almost\narrived.]\n\n53. To be ignorant of any one of the following four or five principles\ndoes not befit a warlike prince.",
      "54. When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship\nshows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy’s forces. He\noverawes his opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining\nagainst him.",
      "[Mei Tao-ch’en constructs one of the chains of reasoning that are so\nmuch affected by the Chinese: \"In attacking a powerful state, if you\ncan divide her forces, you will have a superiority in strength; if you\nhave a superiority in strength, you will overawe the enemy; if you\noverawe the enemy, the neighbouring states will be frightened; and if\nthe neighbouring states are frightened, the enemy’s allies will be\nprevented from joining her.\" The following gives a stronger meaning:\n\"If the great state has once been defeated (before she has had time to\nsummon her allies), then the lesser states will hold aloof and refrain\nfrom massing their forces.\" Ch’en Hao and Chang Yu take the sentence in\nquite another way. The former says: \"Powerful though a prince may be,\nif he attacks a large state, he will be unable to raise enough troops,\nand must rely to some extent on external aid; if he dispenses with\nthis, and with overweening confidence in his own strength, simply tries\nto intimidate the enemy, he will surely be defeated.\" Chang Yu puts his\nview thus: \"If we recklessly attack a large state, our own people will\nbe discontented and hang back. But if (as will then be the case) our\ndisplay of military force is inferior by half to that of the enemy, the\nother chieftains will take fright and refuse to join us.\"]",
      "55. Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor\ndoes he foster the power of other states. He carries out his own secret\ndesigns, keeping his antagonists in awe.\n\n[The train of thought, as said by Li Ch’uan, appears to be this: Secure\nagainst a combination of his enemies, \"he can afford to reject\nentangling alliances and simply pursue his own secret designs, his\nprestige enable him to dispense with external friendships.\"]\n\nThus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms.\n\n[This paragraph, though written many years before the Ch’in State\nbecame a serious menace, is not a bad summary of the policy by which\nthe famous Six Chancellors gradually paved the way for her final\ntriumph under Shih Huang Ti. Chang Yu, following up his previous note,\nthinks that Sun Tzŭ is condemning this attitude of cold-blooded\nselfishness and haughty isolation.]\n\n56. Bestow rewards without regard to rule,\n\n[Wu Tzŭ (ch. 3) less wisely says: \"Let advance be richly rewarded and\nretreat be heavily punished.\"]\n\nissue orders\n\n[Literally, \"hang\" or post up.\"]\n\nwithout regard to previous arrangements;",
      "[\"In order to prevent treachery,\" says Wang Hsi. The general meaning is\nmade clear by Ts’ao Kung’s quotation from the _Ssu-ma Fa:_ \"Give\ninstructions only on sighting the enemy; give rewards when you see\ndeserving deeds.\" Ts’ao Kung’s paraphrase: \"The final instructions you\ngive to your army should not correspond with those that have been\npreviously posted up.\" Chang Yu simplifies this into \"your arrangements\nshould not be divulged beforehand.\" And Chia Lin says: \"there should be\nno fixity in your rules and arrangements.\" Not only is there danger in\nletting your plans be known, but war often necessitates the entire\nreversal of them at the last moment.]\n\nand you will be able to handle a whole army as though you had to do\nwith but a single man.\n\n[Cf. _supra_, § 34.]\n\n57. Confront your soldiers with the deed itself; never let them know\nyour design.\n\n[Literally, \"do not tell them words;\" i.e. do not give your reasons for\nany order. Lord Mansfield once told a junior colleague to \"give no\nreasons\" for his decisions, and the maxim is even more applicable to a\ngeneral than to a judge.]\n\nWhen the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell them\nnothing when the situation is gloomy.\n\n58. Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive; plunge it\ninto desperate straits, and it will come off in safety.",
      "[These words of Sun Tzŭ were once quoted by Han Hsin in explanation of\nthe tactics he employed in one of his most brilliant battles, already\nalluded to on p. 28. In 204 B.C., he was sent against the army of Chao,\nand halted ten miles from the mouth of the Ching-hsing pass, where the\nenemy had mustered in full force. Here, at midnight, he detached a body\nof 2000 light cavalry, every man of which was furnished with a red\nflag. Their instructions were to make their way through narrow defiles\nand keep a secret watch on the enemy. \"When the men of Chao see me in\nfull flight,\" Han Hsin said, \"they will abandon their fortifications\nand give chase. This must be the sign for you to rush in, pluck down\nthe Chao standards and set up the red banners of Han in their stead.\"\nTurning then to his other officers, he remarked: \"Our adversary holds a\nstrong position, and is not likely to come out and attack us until he\nsees the standard and drums of the commander-in-chief, for fear I\nshould turn back and escape through the mountains.\" So saying, he first\nof all sent out a division consisting of 10,000 men, and ordered them\nto form in line of battle with their backs to the River Ti. Seeing this\nmanœuver, the whole army of Chao broke into loud laughter. By this time\nit was broad daylight, and Han Hsin, displaying the generalissimo’s\nflag, marched out of the pass with drums beating, and was immediately\nengaged by the enemy. A great battle followed, lasting for some time;\nuntil at length Han Hsin and his colleague Chang Ni, leaving drums and\nbanner on the field, fled to the division on the river bank, where\nanother fierce battle was raging. The enemy rushed out to pursue them\nand to secure the trophies, thus denuding their ramparts of men; but\nthe two generals succeeded in joining the other army, which was\nfighting with the utmost desperation. The time had now come for the\n2000 horsemen to play their part. As soon as they saw the men of Chao\nfollowing up their advantage, they galloped behind the deserted walls,\ntore up the enemy’s flags and replaced them by those of Han. When the\nChao army looked back from the pursuit, the sight of these red flags\nstruck them with terror. Convinced that the Hans had got in and\noverpowered their king, they broke up in wild disorder, every effort of\ntheir leader to stay the panic being in vain. Then the Han army fell on\nthem from both sides and completed the rout, killing a number and\ncapturing the rest, amongst whom was King Ya himself…. After the\nbattle, some of Han Hsin’s officers came to him and said: \"In the _Art\nof War_ we are told to have a hill or tumulus on the right rear, and a\nriver or marsh on the left front. [This appears to be a blend of Sun\nTzŭ and T’ai Kung. See IX § 9, and note.] You, on the contrary, ordered\nus to draw up our troops with the river at our back. Under these\nconditions, how did you manage to gain the victory?\" The general\nreplied: \"I fear you gentlemen have not studied the Art of War with\nsufficient care. Is it not written there: ‘Plunge your army into\ndesperate straits and it will come off in safety; place it in deadly\nperil and it will survive’? Had I taken the usual course, I should\nnever have been able to bring my colleague round. What says the\nMilitary Classic—‘Swoop down on the market-place and drive the men off\nto fight.’ [This passage does not occur in the present text of Sun\nTzŭ.] If I had not placed my troops in a position where they were\nobliged to fight for their lives, but had allowed each man to follow\nhis own discretion, there would have been a general _débandade_, and it\nwould have been impossible to do anything with them.\" The officers\nadmitted the force of his argument, and said: \"These are higher tactics\nthan we should have been capable of.\" [See _Ch’ien Han Shu_, ch. 34,\nff. 4, 5.] ]",
      "59. For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm’s way that is\ncapable of striking a blow for victory.\n\n[Danger has a bracing effect.]\n\n60. Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves\nto the enemy’s purpose.\n\n[Ts’ao Kung says: \"Feign stupidity\"—by an appearance of yielding and\nfalling in with the enemy’s wishes. Chang Yu’s note makes the meaning\nclear: \"If the enemy shows an inclination to advance, lure him on to do\nso; if he is anxious to retreat, delay on purpose that he may carry out\nhis intention.\" The object is to make him remiss and contemptuous\nbefore we deliver our attack.]\n\n61. By persistently hanging on the enemy’s flank,\n\n[I understand the first four words to mean \"accompanying the enemy in\none direction.\" Ts’ao Kung says: \"unite the soldiers and make for the\nenemy.\" But such a violent displacement of characters is quite\nindefensible.]\n\nwe shall succeed in the long run\n\n[Literally, \"after a thousand _li_.\"]\n\nin killing the commander-in-chief.\n\n[Always a great point with the Chinese.]\n\n62.

      "[Ch’en Hao’s explanation: \"If I manage to seize a favourable position,\nbut the enemy does not appear on the scene, the advantage thus obtained\ncannot be turned to any practical account. He who intends therefore, to\noccupy a position of importance to the enemy, must begin by making an\nartful appointment, so to speak, with his antagonist, and cajole him\ninto going there as well.\" Mei Yao-ch’en explains that this \"artful\nappointment\" is to be made through the medium of the enemy’s own spies,\nwho will carry back just the amount of information that we choose to\ngive them. Then, having cunningly disclosed our intentions, \"we must\nmanage, though starting after the enemy, to arrive before him (VII. §\n4). We must start after him in order to ensure his marching thither; we\nmust arrive before him in order to capture the place without trouble.\nTaken thus, the present passage lends some support to Mei Yao-ch’en’s\ninterpretation of § 47.]\n\n67. Walk in the path defined by rule,\n\n[Chia Lin says: \"Victory is the only thing that matters, and this\ncannot be achieved by adhering to conventional canons.\" It is\nunfortunate that this variant rests on very slight authority, for the\nsense yielded is certainly much more satisfactory.

      "[So Tu Mu. Li Ch’uan says: \"Set fire to the camp, and kill the\nsoldiers\" (when they try to escape from the flames). Pan Ch’ao, sent on\na diplomatic mission to the King of Shan-shan [see XI. § 51, note],\nfound himself placed in extreme peril by the unexpected arrival of an\nenvoy from the Hsiung-nu [the mortal enemies of the Chinese]. In\nconsultation with his officers, he exclaimed: \"Never venture, never\nwin! [1] The only course open to us now is to make an assault by fire\non the barbarians under cover of night, when they will not be able to\ndiscern our numbers. Profiting by their panic, we shall exterminate\nthem completely; this will cool the King’s courage and cover us with\nglory, besides ensuring the success of our mission.’ The officers all\nreplied that it would be necessary to discuss the matter first with the\nIntendant. Pan Ch’ao then fell into a passion: ‘It is today,’ he cried,\n‘that our fortunes must be decided! The Intendant is only a humdrum\ncivilian, who on hearing of our project will certainly be afraid, and\neverything will be brought to light. An inglorious death is no worthy\nfate for valiant warriors.’ All then agreed to do as he wished.\nAccordingly, as soon as night came on, he and his little band quickly\nmade their way to the barbarian camp. A strong gale was blowing at the\ntime. Pan Ch’ao ordered ten of the party to take drums and hide behind\nthe enemy’s barracks, it being arranged that when they saw flames shoot\nup, they should begin drumming and yelling with all their might. The\nrest of his men, armed with bows and crossbows, he posted in ambuscade\nat the gate of the camp. He then set fire to the place from the\nwindward side, whereupon a deafening noise of drums and shouting arose\non the front and rear of the Hsiung-nu, who rushed out pell-mell in\nfrantic disorder. Pan Ch’ao slew three of them with his own hand, while\nhis companions cut off the heads of the envoy and thirty of his suite.\nThe remainder, more than a hundred in all, perished in the flames. On\nthe following day, Pan Ch’ao, divining his thoughts, said with uplifted\nhand: ‘Although you did not go with us last night, I should not think,\nSir, of taking sole credit for our exploit.’ This satisfied Kuo Hsun,\nand Pan Ch’ao, having sent for Kuang, King of Shan-shan, showed him the\nhead of the barbarian envoy. The whole kingdom was seized with fear and\ntrembling, which Pan Ch’ao took steps to allay by issuing a public\nproclamation. Then, taking the king’s sons as hostage, he returned to\nmake his report to Tou Ku.\" _Hou Han Shu_, ch. 47, ff. 1, 2.] ]",
      "the second is to burn stores;\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"Provisions, fuel and fodder.\" In order to subdue the\nrebellious population of Kiangnan, Kao Keng recommended Wen Ti of the\nSui dynasty to make periodical raids and burn their stores of grain, a\npolicy which in the long run proved entirely successful.]\n\nthe third is to burn baggage-trains;\n\n[An example given is the destruction of Yuan Shao’s wagons and\nimpedimenta by Ts’ao Ts’ao in 200 A.D.]\n\nthe fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines;\n\n[Tu Mu says that the things contained in \"arsenals\" and \"magazines\" are\nthe same. He specifies weapons and other implements, bullion and\nclothing. Cf. VII. § 11.]\n\nthe fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.\n\n[Tu Yu says in the _T’ung Tien:_ \"To drop fire into the enemy’s camp.\nThe method by which this may be done is to set the tips of arrows\nalight by dipping them into a brazier, and then shoot them from\npowerful crossbows into the enemy’s lines.\"]\n\n2. In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available.\n\n[T’sao Kung thinks that \"traitors in the enemy’s camp\" are referred to.\nBut Ch’en Hao is more likely to be right in saying: \"We must have\nfavourable circumstances in general, not merely traitors to help us.\"\nChia Lin says: \"We must avail ourselves of wind and dry weather.\"]\n\nthe material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness.",
      "[Tu Mu suggests as material for making fire: \"dry vegetable matter,\nreeds, brushwood, straw, grease, oil, etc.\" Here we have the material\ncause. Chang Yu says: \"vessels for hoarding fire, stuff for lighting\nfires.\"]\n\n3. There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special\ndays for starting a conflagration.\n\n4. The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days\nare those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the\nWall, the Wing or the Cross-bar;\n\n[These are, respectively, the 7th, 14th, 27th, and 28th of the\nTwenty-eight Stellar Mansions, corresponding roughly to Sagittarius,\nPegasus, Crater and Corvus.]\n\nfor these four are all days of rising wind.\n\n5. In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five possible\ndevelopments:\n\n6. (1) When fire breaks out inside the enemy’s camp, respond at once\nwith an attack from without.\n\n7. (2) If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy’s soldiers remain\nquiet, bide your time and do not attack.\n\n[The prime object of attacking with fire is to throw the enemy into\nconfusion. If this effect is not produced, it means that the enemy is\nready to receive us. Hence the necessity for caution.]\n\n8. (3) When the force of the flames has reached its height, follow it\nup with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay where you are.",
      "[Ts’ao Kung says: \"If you see a possible way, advance; but if you find\nthe difficulties too great, retire.\"]\n\n9. (4) If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do\nnot wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a\nfavourable moment.",
      "[Tu Mu says that the previous paragraphs had reference to the fire\nbreaking out (either accidentally, we may suppose, or by the agency of\nincendiaries) inside the enemy’s camp. \"But,\" he continues, \"if the\nenemy is settled in a waste place littered with quantities of grass, or\nif he has pitched his camp in a position which can be burnt out, we\nmust carry our fire against him at any seasonable opportunity, and not\nawait on in hopes of an outbreak occurring within, for fear our\nopponents should themselves burn up the surrounding vegetation, and\nthus render our own attempts fruitless.\" The famous Li Ling once\nbaffled the leader of the Hsiung-nu in this way. The latter, taking\nadvantage of a favourable wind, tried to set fire to the Chinese\ngeneral’s camp, but found that every scrap of combustible vegetation in\nthe neighbourhood had already been burnt down. On the other hand,\nPo-ts’ai, a general of the Yellow Turban rebels, was badly defeated in\n184 A.D. through his neglect of this simple precaution. \"At the head of\na large army he was besieging Ch’ang-she, which was held by Huang-fu\nSung. The garrison was very small, and a general feeling of nervousness\npervaded the ranks; so Huang-fu Sung called his officers together and\nsaid: \"In war, there are various indirect methods of attack, and\nnumbers do not count for everything. [The commentator here quotes Sun\nTzŭ, V. §§ 5, 6 and 10.] Now the rebels have pitched their camp in the\nmidst of thick grass which will easily burn when the wind blows. If we\nset fire to it at night, they will be thrown into a panic, and we can\nmake a sortie and attack them on all sides at once, thus emulating the\nachievement of T’ien Tan.’ [See p. 90.] That same evening, a strong\nbreeze sprang up; so Huang-fu Sung instructed his soldiers to bind\nreeds together into torches and mount guard on the city walls, after\nwhich he sent out a band of daring men, who stealthily made their way\nthrough the lines and started the fire with loud shouts and yells.\nSimultaneously, a glare of light shot up from the city walls, and\nHuang-fu Sung, sounding his drums, led a rapid charge, which threw the\nrebels into confusion and put them to headlong flight.\" [_Hou Han Shu_,\nch. 71.]\n]\n]\n]\n]\n]\n10. (5) When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from\nthe leeward.",
      "[Chang Yu, following Tu Yu, says: \"When you make a fire, the enemy will\nretreat away from it; if you oppose his retreat and attack him then, he\nwill fight desperately, which will not conduce to your success.\" A\nrather more obvious explanation is given by Tu Mu: \"If the wind is in\nthe east, begin burning to the east of the enemy, and follow up the\nattack yourself from that side. If you start the fire on the east side,\nand then attack from the west, you will suffer in the same way as your\nenemy.\"]\n\n11. A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze\nsoon falls.\n\n[Cf. Lao Tzŭ’s saying: \"A violent wind does not last the space of a\nmorning.\" (_Tao Te Ching_, chap. 23.) Mei Yao-ch’en and Wang Hsi say:\n\"A day breeze dies down at nightfall, and a night breeze at daybreak.\nThis is what happens as a general rule.\" The phenomenon observed may be\ncorrect enough, but how this sense is to be obtained is not apparent.]\n\n12. In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be\nknown, the movements of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for the\nproper days.",
      "[Tu Mu says: \"We must make calculations as to the paths of the stars,\nand watch for the days on which wind will rise, before making our\nattack with fire.\" Chang Yu seems to interpret the text differently:\n\"We must not only know how to assail our opponents with fire, but also\nbe on our guard against similar attacks from them.\"]\n\n13. Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence;\nthose who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of\nstrength.\n\n14. By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed of\nall his belongings.\n\n[Ts’ao Kung’s note is: \"We can merely obstruct the enemy’s road or\ndivide his army, but not sweep away all his accumulated stores.\" Water\ncan do useful service, but it lacks the terrible destructive power of\nfire. This is the reason, Chang Yu concludes, why the former is\ndismissed in a couple of sentences, whereas the attack by fire is\ndiscussed in detail. Wu Tzŭ (ch. 4) speaks thus of the two elements:\n\"If an army is encamped on low-lying marshy ground, from which the\nwater cannot run off, and where the rainfall is heavy, it may be\nsubmerged by a flood. If an army is encamped in wild marsh lands\nthickly overgrown with weeds and brambles, and visited by frequent\ngales, it may be exterminated by fire.\"]",
      "15. Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed\nin his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the\nresult is waste of time and general stagnation.\n\n[This is one of the most perplexing passages in Sun Tzŭ. Ts’ao Kung\nsays: \"Rewards for good service should not be deferred a single day.\"\nAnd Tu Mu: \"If you do not take opportunity to advance and reward the\ndeserving, your subordinates will not carry out your commands, and\ndisaster will ensue.\" For several reasons, however, and in spite of the\nformidable array of scholars on the other side, I prefer the\ninterpretation suggested by Mei Yao-ch’en alone, whose words I will\nquote: \"Those who want to make sure of succeeding in their battles and\nassaults must seize the favourable moments when they come and not shrink\non occasion from heroic measures: that is to say, they must resort to\nsuch means of attack of fire, water and the like. What they must not\ndo, and what will prove fatal, is to sit still and simply hold to the\nadvantages they have got.\"]\n\n16. Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead;\nthe good general cultivates his resources.",
      "[Tu Mu quotes the following from the _San Lueh_, ch. 2: \"The warlike\nprince controls his soldiers by his authority, kits them together by\ngood faith, and by rewards makes them serviceable. If faith decays,\nthere will be disruption; if rewards are deficient, commands will not\nbe respected.\"]\n\n17. Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless\nthere is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is\ncritical.\n\n[Sun Tzŭ may at times appear to be over-cautious, but he never goes so\nfar in that direction as the remarkable passage in the _Tao Te Ching_,\nch. 69. \"I dare not take the initiative, but prefer to act on the\ndefensive; I dare not advance an inch, but prefer to retreat a foot.\"]\n\n18. No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own\nspleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique.\n\n19. If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where\nyou are.\n\n[This is repeated from XI. § 17. Here I feel convinced that it is an\ninterpolation, for it is evident that § 20 ought to follow immediately\non § 18.]\n\n20. Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by\ncontent.\n\n21. But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again\ninto being;\n\n[The Wu State was destined to be a melancholy example of this saying.]\n\nnor can the dead ever be brought back to life.",
      "22. Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full\nof caution. This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army\nintact.\n\n[1] \"Unless you enter the tiger’s lair, you cannot get hold of the\ntiger’s cubs.\"\n\nChapter XIII. THE USE OF SPIES\n\n1. Sun Tzŭ said: Raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching\nthem great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on\nthe resources of the State. The daily expenditure will amount to a\nthousand ounces of silver.\n\n[Cf. II. §§ 1, 13, 14.]\n\nThere will be commotion at home and abroad, and men will drop down\nexhausted on the highways.",
      "[Cf. _Tao Te Ching_, ch. 30: \"Where troops have been quartered,\nbrambles and thorns spring up. Chang Yu has the note: \"We may be\nreminded of the saying: ‘On serious ground, gather in plunder.’ Why\nthen should carriage and transportation cause exhaustion on the\nhighways?—The answer is, that not victuals alone, but all sorts of\nmunitions of war have to be conveyed to the army. Besides, the\ninjunction to ‘forage on the enemy’ only means that when an army is\ndeeply engaged in hostile territory, scarcity of food must be provided\nagainst. Hence, without being solely dependent on the enemy for corn,\nwe must forage in order that there may be an uninterrupted flow of\nsupplies. Then, again, there are places like salt deserts where\nprovisions being unobtainable, supplies from home cannot be dispensed\nwith.\"]\n\nAs many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their\nlabor.",
      "[Mei Yao-ch’en says: \"Men will be lacking at the plough-tail.\" The\nallusion is to the system of dividing land into nine parts, each\nconsisting of about 15 acres, the plot in the center being cultivated\non behalf of the State by the tenants of the other eight. It was here\nalso, so Tu Mu tells us, that their cottages were built and a well\nsunk, to be used by all in common. [See II. § 12, note.] In time of\nwar, one of the families had to serve in the army, while the other\nseven contributed to its support. Thus, by a levy of 100,000 men\n(reckoning one able-bodied soldier to each family) the husbandry of\n700,000 families would be affected.]\n\n2. Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the\nvictory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain in\nignorance of the enemy’s condition simply because one grudges the\noutlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honours and emoluments,\n\n[\"For spies\" is of course the meaning, though it would spoil the effect\nof this curiously elaborate exordium if spies were actually mentioned\nat this point.]\n\nis the height of inhumanity.",
      "[Sun Tzŭ’s agreement is certainly ingenious. He begins by adverting to\nthe frightful misery and vast expenditure of blood and treasure which\nwar always brings in its train. Now, unless you are kept informed of\nthe enemy’s condition, and are ready to strike at the right moment, a\nwar may drag on for years. The only way to get this information is to\nemploy spies, and it is impossible to obtain trustworthy spies unless\nthey are properly paid for their services. But it is surely false\neconomy to grudge a comparatively trifling amount for this purpose,\nwhen every day that the war lasts eats up an incalculably greater sum.\nThis grievous burden falls on the shoulders of the poor, and hence Sun\nTzŭ concludes that to neglect the use of spies is nothing less than a\ncrime against humanity.]\n\n3. One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help to his\nsovereign, no master of victory.",
      "[This idea, that the true object of war is peace, has its root in the\nnational temperament of the Chinese. Even so far back as 597 B.C.,\nthese memorable words were uttered by Prince Chuang of the Ch’u State:\n\"The [Chinese] character for ‘prowess’ is made up of [the characters\nfor] ‘to stay’ and ‘a spear’ (cessation of hostilities). Military\nprowess is seen in the repression of cruelty, the calling in of\nweapons, the preservation of the appointment of Heaven, the firm\nestablishment of merit, the bestowal of happiness on the people,\nputting harmony between the princes, the diffusion of wealth.\"]\n\n4. Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike\nand conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is\n_foreknowledge_.\n\n[That is, knowledge of the enemy’s dispositions, and what he means to\ndo.]\n\n5. Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits; it cannot be\nobtained inductively from experience,\n\n[Tu Mu’s note is: \"[knowledge of the enemy] cannot be gained by\nreasoning from other analogous cases.\"]\n\nnor by any deductive calculation.\n\n[Li Ch’uan says: \"Quantities like length, breadth, distance and\nmagnitude, are susceptible of exact mathematical determination; human\nactions cannot be so calculated.\"]\n\n6. Knowledge of the enemy’s dispositions can only be obtained from\nother men.",
      "[Mei Yao-ch’en has rather an interesting note: \"Knowledge of the\nspirit-world is to be obtained by divination; information in natural\nscience may be sought by inductive reasoning; the laws of the universe\ncan be verified by mathematical calculation: but the dispositions of an\nenemy are ascertainable through spies and spies alone.\"]\n\n7. Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes: (1) Local\nspies; (2) inward spies; (3) converted spies; (4) doomed spies; (5)\nsurviving spies.\n\n8. When these five kinds of spy are all at work, none can discover the\nsecret system. This is called \"divine manipulation of the threads.\" It\nis the sovereign’s most precious faculty.\n\n[Cromwell, one of the greatest and most practical of all cavalry\nleaders, had officers styled ‘scout masters,’ whose business it was to\ncollect all possible information regarding the enemy, through scouts\nand spies, etc., and much of his success in war was traceable to the\nprevious knowledge of the enemy’s moves thus gained.\" [1] ]\n\n9. Having _local spies_ means employing the services of the inhabitants\nof a district.\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"In the enemy’s country, win people over by kind\ntreatment, and use them as spies.\"]\n\n10. Having _inward spies_, making use of officials of the enemy.",
      "[Tu Mu enumerates the following classes as likely to do good service in\nthis respect: \"Worthy men who have been degraded from office, criminals\nwho have undergone punishment; also, favourite concubines who are greedy\nfor gold, men who are aggrieved at being in subordinate positions, or\nwho have been passed over in the distribution of posts, others who are\nanxious that their side should be defeated in order that they may have\na chance of displaying their ability and talents, fickle turncoats who\nalways want to have a foot in each boat. Officials of these several\nkinds,\" he continues, \"should be secretly approached and bound to one’s\ninterests by means of rich presents. In this way you will be able to\nfind out the state of affairs in the enemy’s country, ascertain the\nplans that are being formed against you, and moreover disturb the\nharmony and create a breach between the sovereign and his ministers.\"\nThe necessity for extreme caution, however, in dealing with \"inward\nspies,\" appears from an historical incident related by Ho Shih: \"Lo\nShang, Governor of I-Chou, sent his general Wei Po to attack the rebel\nLi Hsiung of Shu in his stronghold at P’i. After each side had\nexperienced a number of victories and defeats, Li Hsiung had recourse\nto the services of a certain P’o-t’ai, a native of Wu-tu. He began to\nhave him whipped until the blood came, and then sent him off to Lo\nShang, whom he was to delude by offering to cooperate with him from\ninside the city, and to give a fire signal at the right moment for\nmaking a general assault. Lo Shang, confiding in these promises, march\nout all his best troops, and placed Wei Po and others at their head\nwith orders to attack at P’o-t’ai’s bidding. Meanwhile, Li Hsiung’s\ngeneral, Li Hsiang, had prepared an ambuscade on their line of march;\nand P’o-t’ai, having reared long scaling-ladders against the city\nwalls, now lighted the beacon-fire. Wei Po’s men raced up on seeing the\nsignal and began climbing the ladders as fast as they could, while\nothers were drawn up by ropes lowered from above. More than a hundred\nof Lo Shang’s soldiers entered the city in this way, every one of whom\nwas forthwith beheaded. Li Hsiung then charged with all his forces,\nboth inside and outside the city, and routed the enemy completely.\"\n[This happened in 303 A.D. I do not know where Ho Shih got the story\nfrom. It is not given in the biography of Li Hsiung or that of his\nfather Li T’e, _Chin Shu_, ch. 120, 121.]",
      "11. Having _converted spies_, getting hold of the enemy’s spies and\nusing them for our own purposes.",
      "[By means of heavy bribes and liberal promises detaching them from the\nenemy’s service, and inducing them to carry back false information as\nwell as to spy in turn on their own countrymen. On the other hand,\nHsiao Shih-hsien says that we pretend not to have detected him, but\ncontrive to let him carry away a false impression of what is going on.\nSeveral of the commentators accept this as an alternative definition;\nbut that it is not what Sun Tzŭ meant is conclusively proved by his\nsubsequent remarks about treating the converted spy generously (§ 21\nsqq.). Ho Shih notes three occasions on which converted spies were used\nwith conspicuous success: (1) by T’ien Tan in his defence of Chi-mo\n(see _supra_, p. 90); (2) by Chao She on his march to O-yu (see p. 57);\nand by the wily Fan Chu in 260 B.C., when Lien P’o was conducting a\ndefensive campaign against Ch’in. The King of Chao strongly disapproved\nof Lien P’o’s cautious and dilatory methods, which had been unable to\navert a series of minor disasters, and therefore lent a ready ear to\nthe reports of his spies, who had secretly gone over to the enemy and\nwere already in Fan Chu’s pay. They said: \"The only thing which causes\nCh’in anxiety is lest Chao Kua should be made general. Lien P’o they\nconsider an easy opponent, who is sure to be vanquished in the long\nrun.\" Now this Chao Kua was a son of the famous Chao She. From his\nboyhood, he had been wholly engrossed in the study of war and military\nmatters, until at last he came to believe that there was no commander\nin the whole Empire who could stand against him. His father was much\ndisquieted by this overweening conceit, and the flippancy with which he\nspoke of such a serious thing as war, and solemnly declared that if\never Kua was appointed general, he would bring ruin on the armies of\nChao. This was the man who, in spite of earnest protests from his own\nmother and the veteran statesman Lin Hsiang-ju, was now sent to succeed\nLien P’o. Needless to say, he proved no match for the redoubtable Po\nCh’i and the great military power of Ch’in. He fell into a trap by\nwhich his army was divided into two and his communications cut; and\nafter a desperate resistance lasting 46 days, during which the famished\nsoldiers devoured one another, he was himself killed by an arrow, and\nhis whole force, amounting, it is said, to 400,000 men, ruthlessly put\nto the sword.]",
      "12. Having _doomed spies_, doing certain things openly for purposes of\ndeception, and allowing our own spies to know of them and report them\nto the enemy.",
      "[Tu Yu gives the best exposition of the meaning: \"We ostentatiously do\nthings calculated to deceive our own spies, who must be led to believe\nthat they have been unwittingly disclosed. Then, when these spies are\ncaptured in the enemy’s lines, they will make an entirely false report,\nand the enemy will take measures accordingly, only to find that we do\nsomething quite different. The spies will thereupon be put to death.\"\nAs an example of doomed spies, Ho Shih mentions the prisoners released\nby Pan Ch’ao in his campaign against Yarkand. (See p. 132.) He also\nrefers to T’ang Chien, who in 630 A.D. was sent by T’ai Tsung to lull\nthe Turkish Kahn Chieh-li into fancied security, until Li Ching was\nable to deliver a crushing blow against him. Chang Yu says that the\nTurks revenged themselves by killing T’ang Chien, but this is a\nmistake, for we read in both the old and the New T’ang History (ch. 58,\nfol. 2 and ch. 89, fol. 8 respectively) that he escaped and lived on\nuntil 656. Li I-chi played a somewhat similar part in 203 B.C., when\nsent by the King of Han to open peaceful negotiations with Ch’i. He has\ncertainly more claim to be described a \"doomed spy\", for the king of\nCh’i, being subsequently attacked without warning by Han Hsin, and\ninfuriated by what he considered the treachery of Li I-chi, ordered the\nunfortunate envoy to be boiled alive.]",
      "13. _Surviving spies_, finally, are those who bring back news from the\nenemy’s camp.",
      "[This is the ordinary class of spies, properly so called, forming a\nregular part of the army. Tu Mu says: \"Your surviving spy must be a man\nof keen intellect, though in outward appearance a fool; of shabby\nexterior, but with a will of iron. He must be active, robust, endowed\nwith physical strength and courage; thoroughly accustomed to all sorts\nof dirty work, able to endure hunger and cold, and to put up with shame\nand ignominy.\" Ho Shih tells the following story of Ta’hsi Wu of the\nSui dynasty: \"When he was governor of Eastern Ch’in, Shen-wu of Ch’i\nmade a hostile movement upon Sha-yuan. The Emperor T’ai Tsu [? Kao Tsu]\nsent Ta-hsi Wu to spy upon the enemy. He was accompanied by two other\nmen. All three were on horseback and wore the enemy’s uniform. When it\nwas dark, they dismounted a few hundred feet away from the enemy’s camp\nand stealthily crept up to listen, until they succeeded in catching the\npasswords used in the army. Then they got on their horses again and\nboldly passed through the camp under the guise of night-watchmen; and\nmore than once, happening to come across a soldier who was committing\nsome breach of discipline, they actually stopped to give the culprit a\nsound cudgeling! Thus they managed to return with the fullest possible\ninformation about the enemy’s dispositions, and received warm\ncommendation from the Emperor, who in consequence of their report was\nable to inflict a severe defeat on his adversary.\"]",
      "14. Hence it is that with none in the whole army are more intimate\nrelations to be maintained than with spies.\n\n[Tu Mu and Mei Yao-ch’en point out that the spy is privileged to enter\neven the general’s private sleeping-tent.]\n\nNone should be more liberally rewarded. In no other business should\ngreater secrecy be preserved.\n\n[Tu Mu gives a graphic touch: all communication with spies should be\ncarried \"mouth-to-ear.\" The following remarks on spies may be quoted\nfrom Turenne, who made perhaps larger use of them than any previous\ncommander: \"Spies are attached to those who give them most, he who pays\nthem ill is never served. They should never be known to anybody; nor\nshould they know one another. When they propose anything very material,\nsecure their persons, or have in your possession their wives and\nchildren as hostages for their fidelity. Never communicate anything to\nthem but what is absolutely necessary that they should know. [2] ]\n\n15. Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive\nsagacity.",
      "[Mei Yao-ch’en says: \"In order to use them, one must know fact from\nfalsehood, and be able to discriminate between honesty and\ndouble-dealing.\" Wang Hsi in a different interpretation thinks more\nalong the lines of \"intuitive perception\" and \"practical intelligence.\"\nTu Mu strangely refers these attributes to the spies themselves:\n\"Before using spies we must assure ourselves as to their integrity of\ncharacter and the extent of their experience and skill.\" But he\ncontinues: \"A brazen face and a crafty disposition are more dangerous\nthan mountains or rivers; it takes a man of genius to penetrate such.\"\nSo that we are left in some doubt as to his real opinion on the\npassage.\"]\n\n16. They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and\nstraightforwardness.\n\n[Chang Yu says: \"When you have attracted them by substantial offers,\nyou must treat them with absolute sincerity; then they will work for\nyou with all their might.\"]\n\n17. Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one cannot make certain of the\ntruth of their reports.\n\n[Mei Yao-ch’en says: \"Be on your guard against the possibility of spies\ngoing over to the service of the enemy.\"]\n\n18. Be subtle! be subtle! and use your spies for every kind of\nbusiness.\n\n[Cf. VI. § 9.]\n\n19. If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is\nripe, he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret\nwas told.",
      "[Word for word, the translation here is: \"If spy matters are heard\nbefore [our plans] are carried out,\" etc. Sun Tzŭ’s main point in this\npassage is: Whereas you kill the spy himself \"as a punishment for\nletting out the secret,\" the object of killing the other man is only,\nas Ch’en Hao puts it, \"to stop his mouth\" and prevent news leaking any\nfurther. If it had already been repeated to others, this object would\nnot be gained. Either way, Sun Tzŭ lays himself open to the charge of\ninhumanity, though Tu Mu tries to defend him by saying that the man\ndeserves to be put to death, for the spy would certainly not have told\nthe secret unless the other had been at pains to worm it out of him.\"]\n\n20. Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm a city, or to\nassassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding\nout the names of the attendants, the aides-de- camp,\n\n[Literally \"visitors\", is equivalent, as Tu Yu says, to \"those whose\nduty it is to keep the general supplied with information,\" which\nnaturally necessitates frequent interviews with him.]\n\nthe door-keepers and sentries of the general in command. Our spies must\nbe commissioned to ascertain these.\n\n[As the first step, no doubt towards finding out if any of these\nimportant functionaries can be won over by bribery.]",
      "21. The enemy’s spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out,\ntempted with bribes, led away and comfortably housed. Thus they will\nbecome converted spies and available for our service.\n\n22. It is through the information brought by the converted spy that we\nare able to acquire and employ local and inward spies.\n\n[Tu Yu says: \"through conversion of the enemy’s spies we learn the\nenemy’s condition.\" And Chang Yu says: \"We must tempt the converted spy\ninto our service, because it is he that knows which of the local\ninhabitants are greedy of gain, and which of the officials are open to\ncorruption.\"]\n\n23. It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed\nspy to carry false tidings to the enemy.\n\n[Chang Yu says, \"because the converted spy knows how the enemy can best\nbe deceived.\"]\n\n24. Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used\non appointed occasions.\n\n25. The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of\nthe enemy; and this knowledge can only be derived, in the first\ninstance, from the converted spy.\n\n[As explained in §§ 22-24. He not only brings information himself, but\nmakes it possible to use the other kinds of spy to advantage.]\n\nHence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost\nliberality.\n\n26. Of old, the rise of the Yin dynasty",
      "[Sun Tzŭ means the Shang dynasty, founded in 1766 B.C. Its name was\nchanged to Yin by P’an Keng in 1401.\n\nwas due to I Chih\n\n[Better known as I Yin, the famous general and statesman who took part\nin Ch’eng T’ang’s campaign against Chieh Kuei.]\n\nwho had served under the Hsia. Likewise, the rise of the Chou dynasty\nwas due to Lü Ya\n\n[Lu Shang rose to high office under the tyrant Chou Hsin, whom he\nafterwards helped to overthrow. Popularly known as T’ai Kung, a title\nbestowed on him by Wen Wang, he is said to have composed a treatise on\nwar, erroneously identified with the _Liu T’ao_.]\n\nwho had served under the Yin.",
      "[There is less precision in the Chinese than I have thought it well to\nintroduce into my translation, and the commentaries on the passage are\nby no means explicit. But, having regard to the context, we can hardly\ndoubt that Sun Tzŭ is holding up I Chih and Lu Ya as illustrious\nexamples of the converted spy, or something closely analogous. His\nsuggestion is, that the Hsia and Yin dynasties were upset owing to the\nintimate knowledge of their weaknesses and shortcoming which these\nformer ministers were able to impart to the other side. Mei Yao-ch’en\nappears to resent any such aspersion on these historic names: \"I Yin\nand Lu Ya,\" he says, \"were not rebels against the Government. Hsia\ncould not employ the former, hence Yin employed him. Yin could not\nemploy the latter, hence Hou employed him. Their great achievements\nwere all for the good of the people.\" Ho Shih is also indignant: \"How\nshould two divinely inspired men such as I and Lu have acted as common\nspies? Sun Tzŭ’s mention of them simply means that the proper use of\nthe five classes of spies is a matter which requires men of the highest\nmental caliber like I and Lu, whose wisdom and capacity qualified them\nfor the task. The above words only emphasize this point.\" Ho Shih\nbelieves then that the two heroes are mentioned on account of their\nsupposed skill in the use of spies. But this is very weak.]",
      "27. Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who\nwill use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying\nand thereby they achieve great results.\n\n[Tu Mu closes with a note of warning: \"Just as water, which carries a\nboat from bank to bank, may also be the means of sinking it, so\nreliance on spies, while production of great results, is oft-times the\ncause of utter destruction.\"]\n\nSpies are a most important element in war, because on them depends an\narmy’s ability to move.\n\n[Chia Lin says that an army without spies is like a man without ears or\neyes.]\n\n[1] \"Aids to Scouting,\" p. 2.\n\n[2] \"Marshal Turenne,\" p. 311."

Alice’s Evidence\n\nCHAPTER I.\nDown the Rabbit-Hole\n\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\nthe book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\nconversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice\n“without pictures or conversations?”\n\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\nmaking a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\nclose by her.",
      "There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\nso _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh\ndear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\nin the world she was to get out again.\n\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\ndeep well.",
      "Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\nwas going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\npassed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\ncupboards as she fell past it.\n\n“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me\nat home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\ntop of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)",
      "Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? “I wonder how\nmany miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be\ngetting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\nbe four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt\nseveral things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\nthough this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\nknowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\npractice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but\nthen I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no\nidea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\ngrand words to say.)\n\nPresently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right _through_\nthe earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk\nwith their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather\nglad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all\nthe right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\ncountry is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”\n(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re\nfalling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what\nan ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do\nto ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”",
      "Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\ntalking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”\n(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\nno mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s\nvery like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here\nAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\ndreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and\nsometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer\neither question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\nwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\n“Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly,\nthump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\nthe fall was over.",
      "Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\nshe looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\nlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\nit. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\nand was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears\nand whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she\nturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\nfrom the roof.\n\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\nAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\ndoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\nget out again.\n\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s\nfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\nbut, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\ntime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\nlittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!",
      "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\npassage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\nout of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\nflowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\nthrough the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought\npoor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,\nhow I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only\nknew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\nhappened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\nindeed were really impossible.\n\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\nback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\nany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\ntime she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here\nbefore,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\nlabel, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large\nletters.",
      "It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was\nnot going to do _that_ in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said,\n“and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not”; for she had read\nseveral nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\neaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\n_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:\nsuch as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;\nand that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually\nbleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\nbottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,\nsooner or later.\n\nHowever, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to\ntaste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed\nflavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\nhot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a\ntelescope.”",
      "And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\nbrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\nthrough the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she\nwaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\nshe felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,”\nsaid Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I\nwonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the\nflame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could\nnot remember ever having seen such a thing.\n\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\ninto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the\ndoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\nwent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\nit: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\nbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\nand when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\nsat down and cried.",
      "“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself,\nrather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally\ngave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\nand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\nher eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\ncheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\nfor this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\n“But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two\npeople! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable\nperson!”\n\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\nshe opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\n“EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said\nAlice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\nmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll\nget into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”",
      "She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which\nway?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\ngrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\nsize: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\nhad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\nthings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go\non in the common way.\n\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\nCHAPTER II.\nThe Pool of Tears\n\n“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!”\n(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\nsight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I\nwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m\nsure _I_ shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be\nkind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I\nwant to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every\nChristmas.”",
      "And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They must\ngo by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending\npresents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\n\n_Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with\n     Alice’s love_).\n\nOh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”\n\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\nnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\nkey and hurried off to the garden door.\n\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\n\n“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like\nyou,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop\nthis moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding\ngallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about\nfour inches deep and reaching half down the hall.",
      "After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves\nin one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a\ngreat hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the\nDuchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt\nso desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the\nRabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please,\nsir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and\nthe fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\n\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear! How\nqueer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.\nI wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the\nsame when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling\na little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who\nin the world am I? Ah, _that’s_ the great puzzle!” And she began\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\nherself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.",
      "“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long\nringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a\nvery little! Besides, _she’s_ she, and _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, how\npuzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know.\nLet me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,\nand four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that\nrate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try\nGeography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\nRome, and Rome—no, _that’s_ all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been\nchanged for Mabel! I’ll try and say ‘_How doth the little_—’” and she\ncrossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began\nto repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words\ndid not come the same as they used to do:—\n\n“How doth the little crocodile\n    Improve his shining tail,\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\n    On every golden scale!\n\n“How cheerfully he seems to grin,\n    How neatly spread his claws,\nAnd welcome little fishes in\n    With gently smiling jaws!”",
      "“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes\nfilled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and\nI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\nno toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve\nmade up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be\nno use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’\nI shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then? Tell me that first, and\nthen, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down\nhere till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden\nburst of tears, “I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so\n_very_ tired of being all alone here!”\n\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\nthat she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while\nshe was talking. “How _can_ I have done that?” she thought. “I must be\ngrowing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure\nherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was\nnow about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon\nfound out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she\ndropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.",
      "“That _was_ a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\nsudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and\nnow for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little\ndoor: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden\nkey was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than\never,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this\nbefore, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”\n\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\nsplash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that\nshe had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by\nrailway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\nher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\nsea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\nof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she\nsoon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\nshe was nine feet high.\n\n“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying\nto find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\nbeing drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be\nsure! However, everything is queer to-day.”",
      "Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\nslipped in like herself.\n\n“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she\nbegan: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\nshe remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of\na mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\nbut it said nothing.",
      "“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all\nher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\nanything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which\nwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\nsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\nfright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\nhad hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like\ncats.”\n\n“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would\n_you_ like cats if you were me?”\n\n“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry\nabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d\ntake a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear\nquiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\nin the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\npaws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to\nnurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your\npardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\nover, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk\nabout her any more if you’d rather not.”",
      "“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\ntail. “As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always\n_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name\nagain!”\n\n“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\nconversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not\nanswer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near\nour house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\nknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when\nyou throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\nof things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you\nknow, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says\nit kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,\n“I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away\nfrom her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\npool as it went.",
      "So she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\nwon’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the\nMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\nwas quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\ntrembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my\nhistory, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”\n\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\nbirds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a\nDodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice\nled the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.\n\nCHAPTER III.\nA Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\n\nThey were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the\nbirds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\nto them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.",
      "The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\nconsultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite\nnatural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if\nshe had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument\nwith the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am\nolder than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow\nwithout knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to\ntell its age, there was no more to be said.\n\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\ncalled out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I’ll_ soon make\nyou dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the\nMouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she\nfelt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\n\n“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This\nis the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William\nthe Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted\nto by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\naccustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of\nMercia and Northumbria—’”\n\n“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.\n\n“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did\nyou speak?”",
      "“Not I!” said the Lory hastily.\n\n“I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar,\nthe earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even\nStigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’”\n\n“Found _what_?” said the Duck.\n\n“Found _it_,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know\nwhat ‘it’ means.”\n\n“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,” said the\nDuck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the\narchbishop find?”\n\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found\nit advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him\nthe crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence\nof his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued,\nturning to Alice as it spoke.\n\n“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to\ndry me at all.”\n\n“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move\nthat the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\nremedies—”\n\n“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half\nthose long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And\nthe Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds\ntittered audibly.",
      "“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was,\nthat the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”\n\n“What _is_ a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to\nknow, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to\nspeak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\n\n“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And,\nas you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will\ntell you how the Dodo managed it.)\n\nFirst it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact\nshape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed\nalong the course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and\naway,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\nliked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\nwhen they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry\nagain, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all\ncrowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”\n\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\nthought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its\nforehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the\npictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo\nsaid, “_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.”",
      "“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.\n\n“Why, _she_, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one\nfinger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a\nconfused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”\n\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\npocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\nnot got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly\none a-piece, all round.\n\n“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.\n\n“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you got in\nyour pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.\n\n“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.\n\n“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.\n\nThen they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\npresented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant\nthimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all\ncheered.\n\nAlice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave\nthat she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything\nto say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as\nshe could.",
      "The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\nconfusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\ntheirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\nHowever, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\nbegged the Mouse to tell them something more.\n\n“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why\nit is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\nwould be offended again.\n\n“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\nsighing.\n\n“It _is_ a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder\nat the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on\npuzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the\ntale was something like this:—\n\n“Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, ‘Let us both\n         go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.—Come, I’ll take no\n         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I’ve\n         nothing to do.’ Said the mouse to the cur, ‘Such a trial, dear\n         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.’\n         ‘I’ll be judge, I’ll be jury,’ Said cunning old Fury: ‘I’ll\n         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.’”\n\n“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely. “What are\nyou thinking of?”",
      "“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth\nbend, I think?”\n\n“I had _not!_” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\n\n“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking\nanxiously about her. “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”\n\n“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and\nwalking away. “You insult me by talking such nonsense!”\n\n“I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But you’re so easily offended,\nyou know!”\n\nThe Mouse only growled in reply.\n\n“Please come back and finish your story!” Alice called after it; and\nthe others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” but the Mouse only\nshook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.\n\n“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was\nquite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to\nher daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose\n_your_ temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a little\nsnappishly. “You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!”\n\n“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud,\naddressing nobody in particular. “She’d soon fetch it back!”\n\n“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said the\nLory.",
      "Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:\n“Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you\ncan’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,\nshe’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”\n\nThis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the\nbirds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very\ncarefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air\ndoesn’t suit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice\nto its children, “Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in\nbed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left\nalone.\n\n“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy\ntone. “Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best\ncat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you\nany more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very\nlonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a\nlittle pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up\neagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was\ncoming back to finish his story.\n\nCHAPTER IV.\nThe Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill",
      "It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\nanxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\nit muttering to itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\nmy fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\nferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a\nmoment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid\ngloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but\nthey were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since\nher swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the\nlittle door, had vanished completely.\n\nVery soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\ncalled out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you\ndoing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and\na fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off\nat once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the\nmistake it had made.",
      "“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How\nsurprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him\nhis fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she\ncame upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\nplate with the name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went in without\nknocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\nreal Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\nfan and gloves.\n\n“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for\na rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she\nbegan fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come\nhere directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute,\nnurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I\ndon’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house\nif it began ordering people about like that!”",
      "By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\nin the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three\npairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\ngloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\nlittle bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label\nthis time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it\nand put it to her lips. “I know _something_ interesting is sure to\nhappen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so\nI’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large\nagain, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”\n\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\ndrunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\nand had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\ndown the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t\ngrow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t\ndrunk quite so much!”",
      "Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\nand very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\nwas not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\none elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\nStill she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\nof the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I\ncan do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?”\n\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\nand she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\nseemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\nagain, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n\n“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t\nalways growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\nrabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and\nyet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\n_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied\nthat kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\none! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And\nwhen I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a\nsorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more _here_.”",
      "“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I _never_ get any older than I am\nnow? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but\nthen—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like _that!_”\n\n“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn\nlessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all\nfor any lesson-books!”\n\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and\nmaking quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes\nshe heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\n\n“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!”\nThen came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\nthe Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\nhouse, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as\nlarge as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\n\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\nthe door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it,\nthat attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll\ngo round and get in at the window.”",
      "“_That_ you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\nshe heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\nhand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\nbut she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\nfrom which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\ncucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\n\nNext came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And\nthen a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here! Digging\nfor apples, yer honour!”\n\n“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come and\nhelp me out of _this!_” (Sounds of more broken glass.)\n\n“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”\n\n“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)\n\n“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\nwindow!”\n\n“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”\n\n“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”",
      "There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\nnow and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at\nall!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out her\nhand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\n_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. “What a number\nof cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I wonder what\nthey’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they\n_could!_ I’m sure _I_ don’t want to stay in here any longer!”\n\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\nrumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all\ntalking together: she made out the words: “Where’s the other\nladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill!\nfetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em\ntogether first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh! they’ll do\nwell enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this\nrope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down!\nHeads below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I\nfancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, _I_ shan’t! _You_ do\nit!—_That_ I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the master says\nyou’re to go down the chimney!”",
      "“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to\nherself. “Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in\nBill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\nI _think_ I can kick a little!”\n\nShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till\nshe heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was)\nscratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\nsaying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited\nto see what would happen next.\n\nThe first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!”\nthen the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then\nsilence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy\nnow—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\nus all about it!”\n\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought\nAlice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m\na deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me\nlike a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”\n\n“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.\n\n“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice\ncalled out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”",
      "There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I\nwonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the\nroof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\nAlice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”\n\n“A barrowful of _what?_” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\nfor the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\nwindow, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to\nthis,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that\nagain!” which produced another dead silence.\n\nAlice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\nlittle cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\nhead. “If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make\n_some_ change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it\nmust make me smaller, I suppose.”",
      "So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\nbegan shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get\nthrough the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of\nlittle animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,\nwas in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\nsomething out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\nappeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\nsafe in a thick wood.\n\n“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she\nwandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the\nsecond thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that\nwill be the best plan.”\n\nIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\narranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\nhow to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\nthe trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\ngreat hurry.",
      "An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\nfeebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little\nthing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to\nit; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it\nmight be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in\nspite of all her coaxing.\n\nHardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\nheld it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\nall its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\nand made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\nto keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\nother side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\nover heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\nvery like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\nmoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\nthe puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\nlittle way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\nall the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\nits tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.",
      "This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\nset off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,\nand till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\n\n“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant\nagainst a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\nleaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d\nonly been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that\nI’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how _is_ it to be managed? I\nsuppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\nquestion is, what?”\n\nThe great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at\nthe flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\nlooked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\nThere was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\nherself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\nbehind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\nwas on the top of it.\n\nShe stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\nmushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue\ncaterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly\nsmoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of\nanything else.",
      "CHAPTER V.\nAdvice from a Caterpillar\n\nThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\nsilence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\naddressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\n\n“Who are _you?_” said the Caterpillar.\n\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\nrather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know\nwho I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\nchanged several times since then.”\n\n“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain\nyourself!”\n\n“I can’t explain _myself_, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m\nnot myself, you see.”\n\n“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.\n\n“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely,\n“for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\ndifferent sizes in a day is very confusing.”\n\n“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.\n\n“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you\nhave to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then\nafter that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little\nqueer, won’t you?”\n\n“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.\n\n“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know\nis, it would feel very queer to _me_.”\n\n“You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are _you?_”",
      "Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\nAlice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such _very_\nshort remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I\nthink, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.”\n\n“Why?” said the Caterpillar.\n\nHere was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\ngood reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant\nstate of mind, she turned away.\n\n“Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something\nimportant to say!”\n\nThis sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\n\n“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.\n\n“Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\ncould.\n\n“No,” said the Caterpillar.\n\nAlice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,\nand perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For\nsome minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded\nits arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So you\nthink you’re changed, do you?”\n\n“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I\nused—and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!”\n\n“Can’t remember _what_ things?” said the Caterpillar.\n\n“Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busy bee,” but it all\ncame different!” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.",
      "“Repeat, ‘_You are old, Father William_,’” said the Caterpillar.\n\nAlice folded her hands, and began:—\n\n“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,\n    “And your hair has become very white;\nAnd yet you incessantly stand on your head—\n    Do you think, at your age, it is right?”\n\n“In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,\n    “I feared it might injure the brain;\nBut, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,\n    Why, I do it again and again.”\n\n“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,\n    And have grown most uncommonly fat;\nYet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—\n    Pray, what is the reason of that?”\n\n“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\n    “I kept all my limbs very supple\nBy the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—\n    Allow me to sell you a couple?”\n\n“You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak\n    For anything tougher than suet;\nYet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—\n    Pray, how did you manage to do it?”\n\n“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,\n    And argued each case with my wife;\nAnd the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\n    Has lasted the rest of my life.”\n\n“You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose\n    That your eye was as steady as ever;\nYet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—\n    What made you so awfully clever?”",
      "“I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”\n    Said his father; “don’t give yourself airs!\nDo you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\n    Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!”\n\n“That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.\n\n“Not _quite_ right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly; “some of the\nwords have got altered.”\n\n“It is wrong from beginning to end,” said the Caterpillar decidedly,\nand there was silence for some minutes.\n\nThe Caterpillar was the first to speak.\n\n“What size do you want to be?” it asked.\n\n“Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one\ndoesn’t like changing so often, you know.”\n\n“I _don’t_ know,” said the Caterpillar.\n\nAlice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life\nbefore, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\n\n“Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar.\n\n“Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn’t\nmind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”\n\n“It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily,\nrearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\n\n“But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she\nthought of herself, “I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily\noffended!”\n\n“You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the\nhookah into its mouth and began smoking again.",
      "This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a\nminute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and\nyawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\nmushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\n“One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\ngrow shorter.”\n\n“One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_” thought Alice to\nherself.\n\n“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\naloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\n\nAlice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,\ntrying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was\nperfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at\nlast she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke\noff a bit of the edge with each hand.\n\n“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\nthe right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a\nviolent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!",
      "She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\nthat there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\nset to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\nso closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\nmouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\nlefthand bit.\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n“Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delight, which\nchanged into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\nwere nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\nan immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\nsea of green leaves that lay far below her.\n\n“What _can_ all that green stuff be?” said Alice. “And where _have_ my\nshoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?”\nShe was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\nexcept a little shaking among the distant green leaves.",
      "As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\nshe tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that\nher neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She\nhad just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was\ngoing to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but\nthe tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\nhiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her\nface, and was beating her violently with its wings.\n\n“Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.\n\n“I’m _not_ a serpent!” said Alice indignantly. “Let me alone!”\n\n“Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued\ntone, and added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothing\nseems to suit them!”\n\n“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.\n\n“I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried\nhedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those\nserpents! There’s no pleasing them!”\n\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\nsaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n\n“As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon;\n“but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I\nhaven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”",
      "“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to\nsee its meaning.\n\n“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the\nPigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I\nshould be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down\nfrom the sky! Ugh, Serpent!”\n\n“But I’m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. “I’m a—I’m a—”\n\n“Well! _What_ are you?” said the Pigeon. “I can see you’re trying to\ninvent something!”\n\n“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\nthe number of changes she had gone through that day.\n\n“A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\ncontempt. “I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\n_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s\nno use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never\ntasted an egg!”\n\n“I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful\nchild; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\nknow.”\n\n“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then\nthey’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.”",
      "This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\nminute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re\nlooking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to\nme whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”\n\n“It matters a good deal to _me_,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not\nlooking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want\n_yours_: I don’t like them raw.”\n\n“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\ndown again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well\nas she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\nand every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while\nshe remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,\nand she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at\nthe other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until\nshe had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.",
      "It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\nfelt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\nand began talking to herself, as usual. “Come, there’s half my plan\ndone now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m\ngoing to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my\nright size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how\n_is_ that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly\nupon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\n“Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them\n_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she\nbegan nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go\nnear the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.\n\nCHAPTER VI.\nPig and Pepper",
      "For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\nto do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\nwood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\notherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\nfish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by\nanother footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\nfrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\nall over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all\nabout, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\n\nThe Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\nsaying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the\nQueen to play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn\ntone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From the Queen.\nAn invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”\n\nThen they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\n\nAlice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood\nfor fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\nFish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\ndoor, staring stupidly up into the sky.\n\nAlice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.",
      "“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for\ntwo reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you\nare; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could\npossibly hear you.” And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary\nnoise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now\nand then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to\npieces.\n\n“Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”\n\n“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on\nwithout attending to her, “if we had the door between us. For instance,\nif you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you\nknow.” He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\nthis Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can’t help it,”\nshe said to herself; “his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his\nhead. But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am I to get in?”\nshe repeated, aloud.\n\n“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”\n\nAt this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\nskimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose,\nand broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\n\n“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\nas if nothing had happened.\n\n“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.",
      "“_Are_ you to get in at all?” said the Footman. “That’s the first\nquestion, you know.”\n\nIt was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. “It’s really\ndreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue.\nIt’s enough to drive one crazy!”\n\nThe Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\nremark, with variations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for\ndays and days.”\n\n“But what am _I_ to do?” said Alice.\n\n“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.\n\n“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s\nperfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in.\n\nThe door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\none end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool\nin the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,\nstirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\n\n“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to\nherself, as well as she could for sneezing.\n\nThere was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed\noccasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\nalternately without a moment’s pause. The only things in the kitchen\nthat did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting\non the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.",
      "“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\nnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why\nyour cat grins like that?”\n\n“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. Pig!”\n\nShe said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\njumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the\nbaby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—\n\n“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t\nknow that cats _could_ grin.”\n\n“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”\n\n“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite\npleased to have got into a conversation.\n\n“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”\n\nAlice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\nbe as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\nwas trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\nfire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\nthe Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a\nshower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\nthem even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\nthat it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.",
      "“Oh, _please_ mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down\nin an agony of terror. “Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!” as an\nunusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it\noff.\n\n“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse\ngrowl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”\n\n“Which would _not_ be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to\nget an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. “Just\nthink of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the\nearth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”\n\n“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”\n\nAlice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\nthe hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\nbe listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or\nis it twelve? I—”\n\n“Oh, don’t bother _me_,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide\nfigures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a\nsort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at\nthe end of every line:\n\n“Speak roughly to your little boy,\n    And beat him when he sneezes:\nHe only does it to annoy,\n    Because he knows it teases.”\n\nCHORUS.\n(In which the cook and the baby joined):\n\n“Wow! wow! wow!”",
      "While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\nthe baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\nthat Alice could hardly hear the words:—\n\n“I speak severely to my boy,\n    I beat him when he sneezes;\nFor he can thoroughly enjoy\n    The pepper when he pleases!”\n\nCHORUS.\n\n“Wow! wow! wow!”\n\n“Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to Alice,\nflinging the baby at her as she spoke. “I must go and get ready to play\ncroquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room. The cook\nthrew a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.\n\nAlice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\nlittle creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,\n“just like a star-fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing was\nsnorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling\nitself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for\nthe first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.",
      "As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\ntwist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\near and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it\nout into the open air. “If I don’t take this child away with me,”\nthought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be\nmurder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and the\nlittle thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).\n“Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all a proper way of\nexpressing yourself.”\n\nThe baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face\nto see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had\na _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also\nits eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did\nnot like the look of the thing at all. “But perhaps it was only\nsobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there\nwere any tears.\n\nNo, there were no tears. “If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,”\nsaid Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind\nnow!” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\nto say which), and they went on for some while in silence.",
      "Alice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do\nwith this creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so\nviolently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time\nthere could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than\na pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it\nfurther.\n\nSo she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\ntrot away quietly into the wood. “If it had grown up,” she said to\nherself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\nrather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other\nchildren she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\nto herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—” when she\nwas a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of\na tree a few yards off.\n\nThe Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\nthought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she\nfelt that it ought to be treated with respect.\n\n“Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\nwhether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little\nwider. “Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on.\n“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”\n\n“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.",
      "“I don’t much care where—” said Alice.\n\n“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.\n\n“—so long as I get _somewhere_,” Alice added as an explanation.\n\n“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long\nenough.”\n\nAlice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another\nquestion. “What sort of people live about here?”\n\n“In _that_ direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives\na Hatter: and in _that_ direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a\nMarch Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.”\n\n“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.\n\n“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad.\nYou’re mad.”\n\n“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.\n\n“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”\n\nAlice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how\ndo you know that you’re mad?”\n\n“To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad. You grant that?”\n\n“I suppose so,” said Alice.\n\n“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry,\nand wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now _I_ growl when I’m pleased,\nand wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad.”\n\n“_I_ call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.\n\n“Call it what you like,” said the Cat. “Do you play croquet with the\nQueen to-day?”\n\n“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited\nyet.”",
      "“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.\n\nAlice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\nthings happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,\nit suddenly appeared again.\n\n“By-the-bye, what became of the baby?” said the Cat. “I’d nearly\nforgotten to ask.”\n\n“It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\nin a natural way.\n\n“I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again.\n\nAlice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\nappear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\nwhich the March Hare was said to live. “I’ve seen hatters before,” she\nsaid to herself; “the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\nperhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it\nwas in March.” As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\nagain, sitting on a branch of a tree.\n\n“Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat.\n\n“I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing\nand vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.”\n\n“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\nbeginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\nremained some time after the rest of it had gone.",
      "“Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a\ngrin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”\n\nShe had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of\nthe March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\nchimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It\nwas so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\nnibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself\nto about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather\ntimidly, saying to herself “Suppose it should be raving mad after all!\nI almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!”\n\nCHAPTER VII.\nA Mad Tea-Party\n\nThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\nMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\nbetween them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\ncushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. “Very\nuncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, as it’s asleep,\nI suppose it doesn’t mind.”\n\nThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\none corner of it: “No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw\nAlice coming. “There’s _plenty_ of room!” said Alice indignantly, and\nshe sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.",
      "“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\n\nAlice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\n“I don’t see any wine,” she remarked.\n\n“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.\n\n“Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.\n\n“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said\nthe March Hare.\n\n“I didn’t know it was _your_ table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great\nmany more than three.”\n\n“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter. He had been looking at\nAlice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first\nspeech.\n\n“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some\nseverity; “it’s very rude.”\n\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_\nwas, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”\n\n“Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they’ve\nbegun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.\n\n“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said\nthe March Hare.\n\n“Exactly so,” said Alice.\n\n“Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.\n\n“I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I\nsay—that’s the same thing, you know.”\n\n“Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter. “You might just as well\nsay that ‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”",
      "“You might just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ‘I like what\nI get’ is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’!”\n\n“You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\ntalking in his sleep, “that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing\nas ‘I sleep when I breathe’!”\n\n“It _is_ the same thing with you,” said the Hatter, and here the\nconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while\nAlice thought over all she could remember about ravens and\nwriting-desks, which wasn’t much.\n\nThe Hatter was the first to break the silence. “What day of the month\nis it?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\npocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\nand holding it to his ear.\n\nAlice considered a little, and then said “The fourth.”\n\n“Two days wrong!” sighed the Hatter. “I told you butter wouldn’t suit\nthe works!” he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\n\n“It was the _best_ butter,” the March Hare meekly replied.\n\n“Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the Hatter grumbled:\n“you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.”\n\nThe March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\nit into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\nnothing better to say than his first remark, “It was the _best_ butter,\nyou know.”",
      "Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. “What a\nfunny watch!” she remarked. “It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t\ntell what o’clock it is!”\n\n“Why should it?” muttered the Hatter. “Does _your_ watch tell you what\nyear it is?”\n\n“Of course not,” Alice replied very readily: “but that’s because it\nstays the same year for such a long time together.”\n\n“Which is just the case with _mine_,” said the Hatter.\n\nAlice felt dreadfully puzzled, The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no\nsort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. “I don’t quite\nunderstand you,” she said, as politely as she could.\n\n“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter, and he poured a little\nhot tea upon its nose.\n\nThe Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\neyes, “Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.”\n\n“Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning to Alice\nagain.\n\n“No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’s the answer?”\n\n“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter.\n\n“Nor I,” said the March Hare.\n\nAlice sighed wearily. “I think you might do something better with the\ntime,” she said, “than waste it in asking riddles that have no\nanswers.”\n\n“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “you wouldn’t talk\nabout wasting _it_. It’s _him_.”\n\n“I don’t know what you mean,” said Alice.",
      "“Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his head\ncontemptuously. “I dare say you never even spoke to Time!”\n\n“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I have to beat\ntime when I learn music.”\n\n“Ah! that accounts for it,” said the Hatter. “He won’t stand beating.\nNow, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything\nyou liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in\nthe morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a\nhint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\ntime for dinner!”\n\n(“I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\n\n“That would be grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but then—I\nshouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.”\n\n“Not at first, perhaps,” said the Hatter: “but you could keep it to\nhalf-past one as long as you liked.”\n\n“Is that the way _you_ manage?” Alice asked.\n\nThe Hatter shook his head mournfully. “Not I!” he replied. “We\nquarrelled last March—just before _he_ went mad, you know—” (pointing\nwith his tea spoon at the March Hare,) “—it was at the great concert\ngiven by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\n\n‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\nHow I wonder what you’re at!’\n\nYou know the song, perhaps?”\n\n“I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.\n\n“It goes on, you know,” the Hatter continued, “in this way:—",
      "‘Up above the world you fly,\nLike a tea-tray in the sky.\n                    Twinkle, twinkle—’”\n\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\n“_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_—” and went on so long that they\nhad to pinch it to make it stop.\n\n“Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,” said the Hatter, “when the\nQueen jumped up and bawled out, ‘He’s murdering the time! Off with his\nhead!’”\n\n“How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed Alice.\n\n“And ever since that,” the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, “he won’t\ndo a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now.”\n\nA bright idea came into Alice’s head. “Is that the reason so many\ntea-things are put out here?” she asked.\n\n“Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter with a sigh: “it’s always tea-time,\nand we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.”\n\n“Then you keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice.\n\n“Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “as the things get used up.”\n\n“But what happens when you come to the beginning again?” Alice ventured\nto ask.\n\n“Suppose we change the subject,” the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\n“I’m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.”\n\n“I’m afraid I don’t know one,” said Alice, rather alarmed at the\nproposal.\n\n“Then the Dormouse shall!” they both cried. “Wake up, Dormouse!” And\nthey pinched it on both sides at once.",
      "The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. “I wasn’t asleep,” he said in a\nhoarse, feeble voice: “I heard every word you fellows were saying.”\n\n“Tell us a story!” said the March Hare.\n\n“Yes, please do!” pleaded Alice.\n\n“And be quick about it,” added the Hatter, “or you’ll be asleep again\nbefore it’s done.”\n\n“Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” the Dormouse began\nin a great hurry; “and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\nthey lived at the bottom of a well—”\n\n“What did they live on?” said Alice, who always took a great interest\nin questions of eating and drinking.\n\n“They lived on treacle,” said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\ntwo.\n\n“They couldn’t have done that, you know,” Alice gently remarked;\n“they’d have been ill.”\n\n“So they were,” said the Dormouse; “_very_ ill.”\n\nAlice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way of\nliving would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: “But\nwhy did they live at the bottom of a well?”\n\n“Take some more tea,” the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\n\n“I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone, “so I can’t\ntake more.”\n\n“You mean you can’t take _less_,” said the Hatter: “it’s very easy to\ntake _more_ than nothing.”\n\n“Nobody asked _your_ opinion,” said Alice.\n\n“Who’s making personal remarks now?” the Hatter asked triumphantly.",
      "Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to\nsome tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\nrepeated her question. “Why did they live at the bottom of a well?”\n\nThe Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\nsaid, “It was a treacle-well.”\n\n“There’s no such thing!” Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\nHatter and the March Hare went “Sh! sh!” and the Dormouse sulkily\nremarked, “If you can’t be civil, you’d better finish the story for\nyourself.”\n\n“No, please go on!” Alice said very humbly; “I won’t interrupt again. I\ndare say there may be _one_.”\n\n“One, indeed!” said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\ngo on. “And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw,\nyou know—”\n\n“What did they draw?” said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\n\n“Treacle,” said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\n\n“I want a clean cup,” interrupted the Hatter: “let’s all move one place\non.”\n\nHe moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\nmoved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the\nplace of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\nadvantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\nbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.",
      "Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\ncautiously: “But I don’t understand. Where did they draw the treacle\nfrom?”\n\n“You can draw water out of a water-well,” said the Hatter; “so I should\nthink you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?”\n\n“But they were _in_ the well,” Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing\nto notice this last remark.\n\n“Of course they were,” said the Dormouse; “—well in.”\n\nThis answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\nsome time without interrupting it.\n\n“They were learning to draw,” the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\nits eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; “and they drew all manner of\nthings—everything that begins with an M—”\n\n“Why with an M?” said Alice.\n\n“Why not?” said the March Hare.\n\nAlice was silent.\n\nThe Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\ndoze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a\nlittle shriek, and went on: “—that begins with an M, such as\nmouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say\nthings are “much of a muchness”—did you ever see such a thing as a\ndrawing of a muchness?”\n\n“Really, now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “I don’t\nthink—”\n\n“Then you shouldn’t talk,” said the Hatter.",
      "This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\ngreat disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\nlooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\nthe last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\nthe teapot.\n\n“At any rate I’ll never go _there_ again!” said Alice as she picked her\nway through the wood. “It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in\nall my life!”\n\nJust as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\nleading right into it. “That’s very curious!” she thought. “But\neverything’s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.” And\nin she went.\n\nOnce more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\nglass table. “Now, I’ll manage better this time,” she said to herself,\nand began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that\nled into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom\n(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot\nhigh: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_—she found\nherself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds\nand the cool fountains.\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\nThe Queen’s Croquet-Ground",
      "A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\ngrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\npainting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she\nwent nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard\none of them say, “Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me\nlike that!”\n\n“I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my\nelbow.”\n\nOn which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five! Always lay the\nblame on others!”\n\n“_You’d_ better not talk!” said Five. “I heard the Queen say only\nyesterday you deserved to be beheaded!”\n\n“What for?” said the one who had spoken first.\n\n“That’s none of _your_ business, Two!” said Seven.\n\n“Yes, it _is_ his business!” said Five, “and I’ll tell him—it was for\nbringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”\n\nSeven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust\nthings—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching\nthem, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,\nand all of them bowed low.\n\n“Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why you are\npainting those roses?”",
      "Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low\nvoice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\n_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen\nwas to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So\nyou see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this\nmoment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\nout “The Queen! The Queen!” and the three gardeners instantly threw\nthemselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,\nand Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.",
      "First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the\nthree gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\ncorners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\ndiamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\nthe royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\njumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all\nornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\nand among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a\nhurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\nby without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\nthe King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\ngrand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\n\nAlice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\nlike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\nof such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a\nprocession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their\nfaces, so that they couldn’t see it?” So she stood still where she was,\nand waited.\n\nWhen the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\nat her, and the Queen said severely “Who is this?” She said it to the\nKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.",
      "“Idiot!” said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\nAlice, she went on, “What’s your name, child?”\n\n“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,” said Alice very politely;\nbut she added, to herself, “Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after\nall. I needn’t be afraid of them!”\n\n“And who are _these?_” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners\nwho were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on\ntheir faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of\nthe pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,\nor courtiers, or three of her own children.\n\n“How should _I_ know?” said Alice, surprised at her own courage. “It’s\nno business of _mine_.”\n\nThe Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\nmoment like a wild beast, screamed “Off with her head! Off—”\n\n“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\nsilent.\n\nThe King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my\ndear: she is only a child!”\n\nThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave “Turn\nthem over!”\n\nThe Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\n\n“Get up!” said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\ngardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,\nthe royal children, and everybody else.",
      "“Leave off that!” screamed the Queen. “You make me giddy.” And then,\nturning to the rose-tree, she went on, “What _have_ you been doing\nhere?”\n\n“May it please your Majesty,” said Two, in a very humble tone, going\ndown on one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”\n\n“_I_ see!” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.\n“Off with their heads!” and the procession moved on, three of the\nsoldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran\nto Alice for protection.\n\n“You shan’t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into a large\nflower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a\nminute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\nothers.\n\n“Are their heads off?” shouted the Queen.\n\n“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers shouted\nin reply.\n\n“That’s right!” shouted the Queen. “Can you play croquet?”\n\nThe soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was\nevidently meant for her.\n\n“Yes!” shouted Alice.\n\n“Come on, then!” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\nwondering very much what would happen next.\n\n“It’s—it’s a very fine day!” said a timid voice at her side. She was\nwalking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\n\n“Very,” said Alice: “—where’s the Duchess?”",
      "“Hush! Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked\nanxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\ntiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered “She’s under\nsentence of execution.”\n\n“What for?” said Alice.\n\n“Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.\n\n“No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said\n‘What for?’”\n\n“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little\nscream of laughter. “Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\ntone. “The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the\nQueen said—”\n\n“Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\npeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\nother; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\nbegan. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground\nin her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live\nhedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double\nthemselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.",
      "The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\nshe succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,\nunder her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she\nhad got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the\nhedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look\nup in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help\nbursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was\ngoing to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog\nhad unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all\nthis, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\nwanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were\nalways getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice\nsoon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\n\nThe players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\nall the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time\nthe Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\nshouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a\nminute.",
      "Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\ndispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\n“and then,” thought she, “what would become of me? They’re dreadfully\nfond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any\none left alive!”\n\nShe was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\ncould get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious\nappearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after\nwatching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said\nto herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\nto.”\n\n“How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\nenough for it to speak with.\n\nAlice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no use\nspeaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one\nof them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\ndown her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\nshe had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there\nwas enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.",
      "“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a\ncomplaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear\noneself speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at\nleast, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how\nconfusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the\narch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\nground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only\nit ran away when it saw mine coming!”\n\n“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.\n\n“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed\nthat the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\n“—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”\n\nThe Queen smiled and passed on.\n\n“Who _are_ you talking to?” said the King, going up to Alice, and\nlooking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.\n\n“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to\nintroduce it.”\n\n“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however, it may\nkiss my hand if it likes.”\n\n“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.\n\n“Don’t be impertinent,” said the King, “and don’t look at me like\nthat!” He got behind Alice as he spoke.\n\n“A cat may look at a king,” said Alice. “I’ve read that in some book,\nbut I don’t remember where.”",
      "“Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly, and he called\nthe Queen, who was passing at the moment, “My dear! I wish you would\nhave this cat removed!”\n\nThe Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or\nsmall. “Off with his head!” she said, without even looking round.\n\n“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly, and he\nhurried off.\n\nAlice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\non, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with\npassion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\nexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\nof things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\nwhether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\n\nThe hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\nto Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\nother: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to\nthe other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a\nhelpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.",
      "By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\nwas over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t\nmatter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side\nof the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\nescape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\nfriend.\n\nWhen she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite\na large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\nthe executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\nwhile all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\n\nThe moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\nthe question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\nall spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\nwhat they said.\n\nThe executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless\nthere was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\nthing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at _his_ time of life.\n\nThe King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be\nbeheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.",
      "The Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in\nless than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was\nthis last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and\nanxious.)\n\nAlice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the\nDuchess: you’d better ask _her_ about it.”\n\n“She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her here.”\nAnd the executioner went off like an arrow.\n\nThe Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the\ntime he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so\nthe King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,\nwhile the rest of the party went back to the game.\n\nCHAPTER IX.\nThe Mock Turtle’s Story\n\n“You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!”\nsaid the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice’s,\nand they walked off together.\n\nAlice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought\nto herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so\nsavage when they met in the kitchen.",
      "“When _I’m_ a Duchess,” she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful\ntone though), “I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup\ndoes very well without—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people\nhot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new\nkind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes\nthem bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children\nsweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn’t be\nso stingy about it, you know—”\n\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\nstartled when she heard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking\nabout something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t\ntell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\na bit.”\n\n“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.\n\n“Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess. “Everything’s got a moral, if only\nyou can find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as\nshe spoke.\n\nAlice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\nDuchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\nright height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an\nuncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she\nbore it as well as she could.",
      "“The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up\nthe conversation a little.\n\n“’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love,\n’tis love, that makes the world go round!’”\n\n“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding\ntheir own business!”\n\n“Ah, well! It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging her\nsharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral of\n_that_ is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\nthemselves.’”\n\n“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to\nherself.\n\n“I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,”\nthe Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about\nthe temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?”\n\n“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious\nto have the experiment tried.\n\n“Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite. And\nthe moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’”\n\n“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.\n\n“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of\nputting things!”\n\n“It’s a mineral, I _think_,” said Alice.",
      "“Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\neverything that Alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here.\nAnd the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is\nof yours.’”\n\n“Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last\nremark, “it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.”\n\n“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that\nis—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more\nsimply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\nappear to others that what you were or might have been was not\notherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be\notherwise.’”\n\n“I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely,\n“if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”\n\n“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied,\nin a pleased tone.\n\n“Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said\nAlice.\n\n“Oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said the Duchess. “I make you a present\nof everything I’ve said as yet.”\n\n“A cheap sort of present!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they don’t give\nbirthday presents like that!” But she did not venture to say it out\nloud.\n\n“Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\nlittle chin.",
      "“I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\nfeel a little worried.\n\n“Just about as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs have to fly; and\nthe m—”\n\nBut here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away,\neven in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was\nlinked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the\nQueen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a\nthunderstorm.\n\n“A fine day, your Majesty!” the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\n\n“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping on the\nground as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and that in\nabout half no time! Take your choice!”\n\nThe Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\n\n“Let’s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too\nmuch frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\ncroquet-ground.\n\nThe other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were\nresting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\nback to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay\nwould cost them their lives.",
      "All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling\nwith the other players, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with\nher head!” Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the\nsoldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so\nthat by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and\nall the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody\nand under sentence of execution.\n\nThen the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, “Have\nyou seen the Mock Turtle yet?”\n\n“No,” said Alice. “I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.”\n\n“It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,” said the Queen.\n\n“I never saw one, or heard of one,” said Alice.\n\n“Come on, then,” said the Queen, “and he shall tell you his history.”\n\nAs they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\nto the company generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come, _that’s_ a\ngood thing!” she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\nnumber of executions the Queen had ordered.",
      "They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If\nyou don’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “Up, lazy\nthing!” said the Queen, “and take this young lady to see the Mock\nTurtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some\nexecutions I have ordered;” and she walked off, leaving Alice alone\nwith the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,\nbut on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it\nas to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.\n\nThe Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\nshe was out of sight: then it chuckled. “What fun!” said the Gryphon,\nhalf to itself, half to Alice.\n\n“What _is_ the fun?” said Alice.\n\n“Why, _she_,” said the Gryphon. “It’s all her fancy, that: they never\nexecutes nobody, you know. Come on!”\n\n“Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought Alice, as she went slowly\nafter it: “I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!”\n\nThey had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\nsitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\nnearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She\npitied him deeply. “What is his sorrow?” she asked the Gryphon, and the\nGryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, “It’s all\nhis fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!”",
      "So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\nfull of tears, but said nothing.\n\n“This here young lady,” said the Gryphon, “she wants for to know your\nhistory, she do.”\n\n“I’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: “sit\ndown, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.”\n\nSo they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to\nherself, “I don’t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn’t begin.”\nBut she waited patiently.\n\n“Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real\nTurtle.”\n\nThese words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\noccasional exclamation of “Hjckrrh!” from the Gryphon, and the constant\nheavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and\nsaying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” but she could not\nhelp thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said\nnothing.\n\n“When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\nthough still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the\nsea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—”\n\n“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” Alice asked.\n\n“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle\nangrily: “really you are very dull!”",
      "“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\nquestion,” added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked\nat poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the\nGryphon said to the Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all\nday about it!” and he went on in these words:\n\n“Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—”\n\n“I never said I didn’t!” interrupted Alice.\n\n“You did,” said the Mock Turtle.\n\n“Hold your tongue!” added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.\nThe Mock Turtle went on.\n\n“We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—”\n\n“_I’ve_ been to a day-school, too,” said Alice; “you needn’t be so\nproud as all that.”\n\n“With extras?” asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\n\n“Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French and music.”\n\n“And washing?” said the Mock Turtle.\n\n“Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly.\n\n“Ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,” said the Mock Turtle in a\ntone of great relief. “Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,\n‘French, music, _and washing_—extra.’”\n\n“You couldn’t have wanted it much,” said Alice; “living at the bottom\nof the sea.”\n\n“I couldn’t afford to learn it.” said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. “I\nonly took the regular course.”\n\n“What was that?” inquired Alice.",
      "“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” the Mock Turtle\nreplied; “and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition,\nDistraction, Uglification, and Derision.”\n\n“I never heard of ‘Uglification,’” Alice ventured to say. “What is it?”\n\nThe Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. “What! Never heard of\nuglifying!” it exclaimed. “You know what to beautify is, I suppose?”\n\n“Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.”\n\n“Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify\nis, you _are_ a simpleton.”\n\nAlice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so\nshe turned to the Mock Turtle, and said “What else had you to learn?”\n\n“Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the\nsubjects on his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient and modern, with\nSeaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\nthat used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and\nFainting in Coils.”\n\n“What was _that_ like?” said Alice.\n\n“Well, I can’t show it you myself,” the Mock Turtle said: “I’m too\nstiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.”\n\n“Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon: “I went to the Classics master,\nthough. He was an old crab, _he_ was.”\n\n“I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: “he taught\nLaughing and Grief, they used to say.”",
      "“So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\ncreatures hid their faces in their paws.\n\n“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry\nto change the subject.\n\n“Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine the next, and so\non.”\n\n“What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice.\n\n“That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked:\n“because they lessen from day to day.”\n\nThis was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little\nbefore she made her next remark. “Then the eleventh day must have been\na holiday?”\n\n“Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle.\n\n“And how did you manage on the twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly.\n\n“That’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in a very\ndecided tone: “tell her something about the games now.”\n\nCHAPTER X.\nThe Lobster Quadrille\n\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\nhis eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\ntwo sobs choked his voice. “Same as if he had a bone in his throat,”\nsaid the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\nthe back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\nrunning down his cheeks, he went on again:—",
      "“You may not have lived much under the sea—” (“I haven’t,” said\nAlice)—“and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—”\n(Alice began to say “I once tasted—” but checked herself hastily, and\nsaid “No, never”) “—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\nLobster Quadrille is!”\n\n“No, indeed,” said Alice. “What sort of a dance is it?”\n\n“Why,” said the Gryphon, “you first form into a line along the\nsea-shore—”\n\n“Two lines!” cried the Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\nthen, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”\n\n“_That_ generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon.\n\n“—you advance twice—”\n\n“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the Gryphon.\n\n“Of course,” the Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set to partners—”\n\n“—change lobsters, and retire in same order,” continued the Gryphon.\n\n“Then, you know,” the Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—”\n\n“The lobsters!” shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\n\n“—as far out to sea as you can—”\n\n“Swim after them!” screamed the Gryphon.\n\n“Turn a somersault in the sea!” cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly\nabout.\n\n“Change lobsters again!” yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.",
      "“Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” said the Mock\nTurtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had\nbeen jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very\nsadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.\n\n“It must be a very pretty dance,” said Alice timidly.\n\n“Would you like to see a little of it?” said the Mock Turtle.\n\n“Very much indeed,” said Alice.\n\n“Come, let’s try the first figure!” said the Mock Turtle to the\nGryphon. “We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?”\n\n“Oh, _you_ sing,” said the Gryphon. “I’ve forgotten the words.”\n\nSo they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\nthen treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\nforepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\nand sadly:—\n\n“Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.\n“There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.\nSee how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\nThey are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?",
      "“You can really have no notion how delightful it will be\nWhen they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”\nBut the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance—\nSaid he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.\n\n“What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied.\n“There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\nThe further off from England the nearer is to France—\nThen turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?”\n\n“Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,” said Alice,\nfeeling very glad that it was over at last: “and I do so like that\ncurious song about the whiting!”\n\n“Oh, as to the whiting,” said the Mock Turtle, “they—you’ve seen them,\nof course?”\n\n“Yes,” said Alice, “I’ve often seen them at dinn—” she checked herself\nhastily.\n\n“I don’t know where Dinn may be,” said the Mock Turtle, “but if you’ve\nseen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.”\n\n“I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully. “They have their tails in\ntheir mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.”",
      "“You’re wrong about the crumbs,” said the Mock Turtle: “crumbs would\nall wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;\nand the reason is—” here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his\neyes.—“Tell her about the reason and all that,” he said to the Gryphon.\n\n“The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they _would_ go with the\nlobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to\nfall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they\ncouldn’t get them out again. That’s all.”\n\n“Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting. I never knew so much\nabout a whiting before.”\n\n“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon. “Do you\nknow why it’s called a whiting?”\n\n“I never thought about it,” said Alice. “Why?”\n\n“_It does the boots and shoes_,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\n\nAlice was thoroughly puzzled. “Does the boots and shoes!” she repeated\nin a wondering tone.\n\n“Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?” said the Gryphon. “I mean, what\nmakes them so shiny?”\n\nAlice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\nanswer. “They’re done with blacking, I believe.”\n\n“Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\n“are done with a whiting. Now you know.”\n\n“And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.",
      "“Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:\n“any shrimp could have told you that.”\n\n“If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts were still\nrunning on the song, “I’d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back,\nplease: we don’t want _you_ with us!’”\n\n“They were obliged to have him with them,” the Mock Turtle said: “no\nwise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.”\n\n“Wouldn’t it really?” said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\n\n“Of course not,” said the Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish came to _me_,\nand told me he was going a journey, I should say ‘With what porpoise?’”\n\n“Don’t you mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice.\n\n“I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And\nthe Gryphon added “Come, let’s hear some of _your_ adventures.”\n\n“I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,” said\nAlice a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday,\nbecause I was a different person then.”\n\n“Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.\n\n“No, no! The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:\n“explanations take such a dreadful time.”",
      "So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\nsaw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,\nthe two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\ntheir eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she\nwent on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part\nabout her repeating “_You are old, Father William_,” to the\nCaterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock\nTurtle drew a long breath, and said “That’s very curious.”\n\n“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.\n\n“It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. “I\nshould like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to\nbegin.” He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of\nauthority over Alice.\n\n“Stand up and repeat ‘’_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,’” said the\nGryphon.\n\n“How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!”\nthought Alice; “I might as well be at school at once.” However, she got\nup, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster\nQuadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came\nvery queer indeed:—",
      "“’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\n“You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.”\nAs a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\nTrims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.”\n\n[later editions continued as follows\nWhen the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\nAnd will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\nBut, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\nHis voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]\n\n“That’s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,” said\nthe Gryphon.\n\n“Well, I never heard it before,” said the Mock Turtle; “but it sounds\nuncommon nonsense.”\n\nAlice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,\nwondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.\n\n“I should like to have it explained,” said the Mock Turtle.\n\n“She can’t explain it,” said the Gryphon hastily. “Go on with the next\nverse.”\n\n“But about his toes?” the Mock Turtle persisted. “How _could_ he turn\nthem out with his nose, you know?”\n\n“It’s the first position in dancing.” Alice said; but was dreadfully\npuzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.\n\n“Go on with the next verse,” the Gryphon repeated impatiently: “it\nbegins ‘_I passed by his garden_.’”\n\nAlice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come\nwrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:—",
      "“I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\nHow the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—”\n\n[later editions continued as follows\nThe Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\nWhile the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.\nWhen the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,\nWas kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\nWhile the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\nAnd concluded the banquet—]\n\n“What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,” the Mock Turtle\ninterrupted, “if you don’t explain it as you go on? It’s by far the\nmost confusing thing _I_ ever heard!”\n\n“Yes, I think you’d better leave off,” said the Gryphon: and Alice was\nonly too glad to do so.\n\n“Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?” the Gryphon\nwent on. “Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?”\n\n“Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,” Alice\nreplied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,\n“Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her ‘_Turtle Soup_,’ will you, old\nfellow?”\n\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked\nwith sobs, to sing this:—",
      "“Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,\nWaiting in a hot tureen!\nWho for such dainties would not stoop?\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\nSoo—oop of the e—e—evening,\n    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\n\n“Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,\nGame, or any other dish?\nWho would not give all else for two p\nennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\nPennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\nSoo—oop of the e—e—evening,\n    Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!”\n\n“Chorus again!” cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun\nto repeat it, when a cry of “The trial’s beginning!” was heard in the\ndistance.\n\n“Come on!” cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried\noff, without waiting for the end of the song.\n\n“What trial is it?” Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only\nanswered “Come on!” and ran the faster, while more and more faintly\ncame, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:—\n\n“Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,\n    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!”\n\nCHAPTER XI.\nWho Stole the Tarts?",
      "The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\narrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little\nbirds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\nstanding before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\nhim; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one\nhand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the\ncourt was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so\ngood, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them—“I wish they’d\nget the trial done,” she thought, “and hand round the refreshments!”\nBut there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at\neverything about her, to pass away the time.\n\nAlice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\nabout them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\nthe name of nearly everything there. “That’s the judge,” she said to\nherself, “because of his great wig.”\n\nThe judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\nwig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he\ndid not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.",
      "“And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve creatures,”\n(she was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them were\nanimals, and some were birds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.” She\nsaid this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather\nproud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little\ngirls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, “jury-men”\nwould have done just as well.\n\nThe twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. “What are\nthey doing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t have anything\nto put down yet, before the trial’s begun.”\n\n“They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply,\n“for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.”\n\n“Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she\nstopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the\ncourt!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,\nto make out who was talking.\n\nAlice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\nthat all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates,\nand she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell\n“stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice\nmuddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought Alice.",
      "One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice\ncould _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\nvery soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly\nthat the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out\nat all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he\nwas obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this\nwas of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\n\n“Herald, read the accusation!” said the King.\n\nOn this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\nunrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:—\n\n“The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\n    All on a summer day:\nThe Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\n    And took them quite away!”\n\n“Consider your verdict,” the King said to the jury.\n\n“Not yet, not yet!” the Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There’s a great\ndeal to come before that!”\n\n“Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew\nthree blasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!”\n\nThe first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand\nand a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. “I beg pardon, your\nMajesty,” he began, “for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished\nmy tea when I was sent for.”\n\n“You ought to have finished,” said the King. “When did you begin?”",
      "The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the\ncourt, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. “Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it\nwas,” he said.\n\n“Fifteenth,” said the March Hare.\n\n“Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse.\n\n“Write that down,” the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly\nwrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and\nreduced the answer to shillings and pence.\n\n“Take off your hat,” the King said to the Hatter.\n\n“It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter.\n\n“_Stolen!_” the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made\na memorandum of the fact.\n\n“I keep them to sell,” the Hatter added as an explanation; “I’ve none\nof my own. I’m a hatter.”\n\nHere the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\nwho turned pale and fidgeted.\n\n“Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t be nervous, or I’ll\nhave you executed on the spot.”\n\nThis did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\nfrom one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his\nconfusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\nbread-and-butter.",
      "Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\nher a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\ngrow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\nthe court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was\nas long as there was room for her.\n\n“I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so,” said the Dormouse, who was sitting\nnext to her. “I can hardly breathe.”\n\n“I can’t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “I’m growing.”\n\n“You’ve no right to grow _here_,” said the Dormouse.\n\n“Don’t talk nonsense,” said Alice more boldly: “you know you’re growing\ntoo.”\n\n“Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,” said the Dormouse: “not in\nthat ridiculous fashion.” And he got up very sulkily and crossed over\nto the other side of the court.\n\nAll this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\njust as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\nof the court, “Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!”\non which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes\noff.\n\n“Give your evidence,” the King repeated angrily, “or I’ll have you\nexecuted, whether you’re nervous or not.”\n\n“I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\n“—and I hadn’t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the\nbread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—”",
      "“The twinkling of the _what?_” said the King.\n\n“It _began_ with the tea,” the Hatter replied.\n\n“Of course twinkling begins with a T!” said the King sharply. “Do you\ntake me for a dunce? Go on!”\n\n“I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most things twinkled after\nthat—only the March Hare said—”\n\n“I didn’t!” the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\n\n“You did!” said the Hatter.\n\n“I deny it!” said the March Hare.\n\n“He denies it,” said the King: “leave out that part.”\n\n“Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on, looking\nanxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\nnothing, being fast asleep.\n\n“After that,” continued the Hatter, “I cut some more bread-and-butter—”\n\n“But what did the Dormouse say?” one of the jury asked.\n\n“That I can’t remember,” said the Hatter.\n\n“You _must_ remember,” remarked the King, “or I’ll have you executed.”\n\nThe miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\ndown on one knee. “I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” he began.\n\n“You’re a _very_ poor _speaker_,” said the King.\n\nHere one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\nthe officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just\nexplain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied\nup at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\nhead first, and then sat upon it.)",
      "“I’m glad I’ve seen that done,” thought Alice. “I’ve so often read in\nthe newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempts at\napplause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the\ncourt,” and I never understood what it meant till now.”\n\n“If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,” continued the\nKing.\n\n“I can’t go no lower,” said the Hatter: “I’m on the floor, as it is.”\n\n“Then you may _sit_ down,” the King replied.\n\nHere the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\n\n“Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!” thought Alice. “Now we shall get\non better.”\n\n“I’d rather finish my tea,” said the Hatter, with an anxious look at\nthe Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\n\n“You may go,” said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,\nwithout even waiting to put his shoes on.\n\n“—and just take his head off outside,” the Queen added to one of the\nofficers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get\nto the door.\n\n“Call the next witness!” said the King.\n\nThe next witness was the Duchess’s cook. She carried the pepper-box in\nher hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the\ncourt, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.\n\n“Give your evidence,” said the King.\n\n“Shan’t,” said the cook.",
      "The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,\n“Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.”\n\n“Well, if I must, I must,” the King said, with a melancholy air, and,\nafter folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were\nnearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, “What are tarts made of?”\n\n“Pepper, mostly,” said the cook.\n\n“Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind her.\n\n“Collar that Dormouse,” the Queen shrieked out. “Behead that Dormouse!\nTurn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his\nwhiskers!”\n\nFor some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse\nturned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had\ndisappeared.\n\n“Never mind!” said the King, with an air of great relief. “Call the\nnext witness.” And he added in an undertone to the Queen, “Really, my\ndear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my\nforehead ache!”\n\nAlice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling\nvery curious to see what the next witness would be like, “—for they\nhaven’t got much evidence _yet_,” she said to herself. Imagine her\nsurprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill\nlittle voice, the name “Alice!”\n\nCHAPTER XII.\nAlice’s Evidence",
      "“Here!” cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\nlarge she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such\na hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,\nupsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there\nthey lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of\ngoldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.\n\n“Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!” she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and\nbegan picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident\nof the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of\nidea that they must be collected at once and put back into the\njury-box, or they would die.\n\n“The trial cannot proceed,” said the King in a very grave voice, “until\nall the jurymen are back in their proper places—_all_,” he repeated\nwith great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.\n\nAlice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put\nthe Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its\ntail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon\ngot it out again, and put it right; “not that it signifies much,” she\nsaid to herself; “I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the\ntrial one way up as the other.”",
      "As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\nupset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\nthem, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\naccident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\nanything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\ncourt.\n\n“What do you know about this business?” the King said to Alice.\n\n“Nothing,” said Alice.\n\n“Nothing _whatever?_” persisted the King.\n\n“Nothing whatever,” said Alice.\n\n“That’s very important,” the King said, turning to the jury. They were\njust beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White\nRabbit interrupted: “_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,” he\nsaid in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as\nhe spoke.\n\n“_Un_important, of course, I meant,” the King hastily said, and went on\nto himself in an undertone,\n\n“important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” as if he were trying\nwhich word sounded best.\n\nSome of the jury wrote it down “important,” and some “unimportant.”\nAlice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;\n“but it doesn’t matter a bit,” she thought to herself.",
      "At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in\nhis note-book, cackled out “Silence!” and read out from his book, “Rule\nForty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.”\n\nEverybody looked at Alice.\n\n“_I’m_ not a mile high,” said Alice.\n\n“You are,” said the King.\n\n“Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen.\n\n“Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,” said Alice: “besides, that’s not a\nregular rule: you invented it just now.”\n\n“It’s the oldest rule in the book,” said the King.\n\n“Then it ought to be Number One,” said Alice.\n\nThe King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. “Consider your\nverdict,” he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.\n\n“There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,” said the\nWhite Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; “this paper has just been\npicked up.”\n\n“What’s in it?” said the Queen.\n\n“I haven’t opened it yet,” said the White Rabbit, “but it seems to be a\nletter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody.”\n\n“It must have been that,” said the King, “unless it was written to\nnobody, which isn’t usual, you know.”\n\n“Who is it directed to?” said one of the jurymen.\n\n“It isn’t directed at all,” said the White Rabbit; “in fact, there’s\nnothing written on the _outside_.” He unfolded the paper as he spoke,\nand added “It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.”",
      "“Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?” asked another of the jurymen.\n\n“No, they’re not,” said the White Rabbit, “and that’s the queerest\nthing about it.” (The jury all looked puzzled.)\n\n“He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,” said the King. (The jury\nall brightened up again.)\n\n“Please your Majesty,” said the Knave, “I didn’t write it, and they\ncan’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.”\n\n“If you didn’t sign it,” said the King, “that only makes the matter\nworse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed\nyour name like an honest man.”\n\nThere was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really\nclever thing the King had said that day.\n\n“That _proves_ his guilt,” said the Queen.\n\n“It proves nothing of the sort!” said Alice. “Why, you don’t even know\nwhat they’re about!”\n\n“Read them,” said the King.\n\nThe White Rabbit put on his spectacles. “Where shall I begin, please\nyour Majesty?” he asked.\n\n“Begin at the beginning,” the King said gravely, “and go on till you\ncome to the end: then stop.”\n\nThese were the verses the White Rabbit read:—\n\n“They told me you had been to her,\n    And mentioned me to him:\nShe gave me a good character,\n    But said I could not swim.\n\nHe sent them word I had not gone\n    (We know it to be true):\nIf she should push the matter on,\n    What would become of you?",
      "I gave her one, they gave him two,\n    You gave us three or more;\nThey all returned from him to you,\n    Though they were mine before.\n\nIf I or she should chance to be\n    Involved in this affair,\nHe trusts to you to set them free,\n    Exactly as we were.\n\nMy notion was that you had been\n    (Before she had this fit)\nAn obstacle that came between\n    Him, and ourselves, and it.\n\nDon’t let him know she liked them best,\n    For this must ever be\nA secret, kept from all the rest,\n    Between yourself and me.”\n\n“That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,” said the\nKing, rubbing his hands; “so now let the jury—”\n\n“If any one of them can explain it,” said Alice, (she had grown so\nlarge in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of\ninterrupting him,) “I’ll give him sixpence. _I_ don’t believe there’s\nan atom of meaning in it.”\n\nThe jury all wrote down on their slates, “_She_ doesn’t believe there’s\nan atom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to explain the\npaper.\n\n“If there’s no meaning in it,” said the King, “that saves a world of\ntrouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. And yet I don’t\nknow,” he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at\nthem with one eye; “I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.\n“—_said I could not swim_—” you can’t swim, can you?” he added, turning\nto the Knave.",
      "The Knave shook his head sadly. “Do I look like it?” he said. (Which he\ncertainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)\n\n“All right, so far,” said the King, and he went on muttering over the\nverses to himself: “‘_We know it to be true_—’ that’s the jury, of\ncourse—‘_I gave her one, they gave him two_—’ why, that must be what he\ndid with the tarts, you know—”\n\n“But, it goes on ‘_they all returned from him to you_,’” said Alice.\n\n“Why, there they are!” said the King triumphantly, pointing to the\ntarts on the table. “Nothing can be clearer than _that_. Then\nagain—‘_before she had this fit_—’ you never had fits, my dear, I\nthink?” he said to the Queen.\n\n“Never!” said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\nas she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\nslate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\nbegan again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long\nas it lasted.)\n\n“Then the words don’t _fit_ you,” said the King, looking round the\ncourt with a smile. There was a dead silence.\n\n“It’s a pun!” the King added in an offended tone, and everybody\nlaughed, “Let the jury consider their verdict,” the King said, for\nabout the twentieth time that day.\n\n“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”\n\n“Stuff and nonsense!” said Alice loudly. “The idea of having the\nsentence first!”",
      "“Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple.\n\n“I won’t!” said Alice.\n\n“Off with her head!” the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody\nmoved.\n\n“Who cares for you?” said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by\nthis time.) “You’re nothing but a pack of cards!”\n\nAt this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\nher: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\ntried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\nhead in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\nleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\n\n“Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister; “Why, what a long sleep you’ve\nhad!”\n\n“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she told her\nsister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange\nAdventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she\nhad finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It _was_ a curious\ndream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.”\nSo Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\nwhat a wonderful dream it had been.\n\nBut her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\nhand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all\nher wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,\nand this was her dream:—",
      "First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\nhands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were\nlooking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and\nsee that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair\nthat _would_ always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or\nseemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the\nstrange creatures of her little sister’s dream.\n\nThe long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the\nfrightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she\ncould hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\nshared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\nordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby\nwas sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed\naround it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\nLizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\nTurtle.",
      "So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\nwould change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the\nwind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling\nteacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill\ncries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the\nshriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change\n(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the\nlowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock\nTurtle’s heavy sobs.\n\nLastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\nwould, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\nkeep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\nchildhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,\nand make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,\nperhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she\nwould feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all\ntheir simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer\ndays.\n\nTHE END"

      "_Walt Whitman has somewhere a fine and just distinction between “loving\nby allowance” and “loving with personal love.” This distinction applies\nto books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very\nnumerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, it\nbrings a curious consequence with it. There is much more difference as\nto their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “by\nallowance” by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and\nproper thing to love them. And in the sect--fairly large and yet\nunusually choice--of Austenians or Janites, there would probably be\nfound partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the\nnovels. To some the delightful freshness and humour of_ Northanger\nAbbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure the undoubted\ncritical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that\nof burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with\ndifficulty._ Persuasion, _relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling\nin interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite\ndelicacy and keeping. The catastrophe of_ Mansfield Park _is admittedly\ntheatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost\nwickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that\nEdmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny might\nvery likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;\nyet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris and\nothers have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it._ Sense and\nSensibility _has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does\nnot want them._",
      "_I suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent votes\nwould, all things considered, be divided between_ Emma _and the present\nbook; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for Miss\nAusten be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge\nof vulgarity) would go for_ Emma. _It is the larger, the more varied, the\nmore popular; the author had by the time of its composition seen rather\nmore of the world, and had improved her general, though not her most\npeculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as Miss Bates, as the\nEltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. On the other hand,\nI, for my part, declare for_ Pride and Prejudice _unhesitatingly. It\nseems to me the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most\neminently quintessential of its author’s works; and for this contention\nin such narrow space as is permitted to me, I propose here to show\ncause._",
      "_In the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the\nreader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,\nwhen Miss Austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised and\nfinished at Chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till\n1813, only four years before her death. I do not know whether, in this\ncombination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth, and the\ncritical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinct\nsuperiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, it\npossesses over all the others. The plot, though not elaborate, is almost\nregular enough for Fielding; hardly a character, hardly an incident\ncould be retrenched without loss to the story. The elopement of Lydia\nand Wickham is not, like that of Crawford and Mrs. Rushworth, a_ coup de\nthéâtre; _it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the\nstory earlier, and brings about the denouement with complete propriety.\nAll the minor passages--the loves of Jane and Bingley, the advent of Mr.\nCollins, the visit to Hunsford, the Derbyshire tour--fit in after the\nsame unostentatious, but masterly fashion. There is no attempt at the\nhide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions between\nFrank Churchill and Jane Fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the\nintrigue of_ Emma, _but contributes it in a fashion which I do not think\nthe best feature of that otherwise admirable book. Although Miss Austen\nalways liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded her\nopportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to\nbe noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectly\nnatural occasions provided by the false account of Darcy’s conduct given\nby Wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from\nthe gradual transformation of Elizabeth’s own feelings from positive\naversion to actual love. I do not know whether the all-grasping hand of\nthe playwright has ever been laid upon_ Pride and Prejudice; _and I dare\nsay that, if it were, the situations would prove not startling or\ngarish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle and\ndelicate for pit and gallery. But if the attempt were made, it would\ncertainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction,\nwhich, sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can\navail himself, appear at once on the stage._",
      "_I think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to\nmore than one school of critics, that construction is not the highest\nmerit, the choicest gift, of the novelist. It sets off his other gifts\nand graces most advantageously to the critical eye; and the want of it\nwill sometimes mar those graces--appreciably, though not quite\nconsciously--to eyes by no means ultra-critical. But a very badly-built\nnovel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or which\ndisplayed consummate command of dialogue--perhaps the rarest of all\nfaculties--would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot\nacted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. And despite the\nability which Miss Austen has shown in working out the story, I for one\nshould put_ Pride and Prejudice _far lower if it did not contain what\nseem to me the very masterpieces of Miss Austen’s humour and of her\nfaculty of character-creation--masterpieces who may indeed admit John\nThorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others to their company,\nbut who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still\nsuperior to them._",
      "_The characteristics of Miss Austen’s humour are so subtle and delicate\nthat they are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than to\nexpress, and at any particular time likely to be differently\napprehended by different persons. To me this humour seems to possess a\ngreater affinity, on the whole, to that of Addison than to any other of\nthe numerous species of this great British genus. The differences of\nscheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course,\nobvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much,\nfor there was a distinctly feminine element in “Mr. Spectator,” and in\nJane Austen’s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was\nmasculine. But the likeness of quality consists in a great number of\ncommon subdivisions of quality--demureness, extreme minuteness of touch,\navoidance of loud tones and glaring effects. Also there is in both a\ncertain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty. It is the custom with those\nwho judge grossly to contrast the good nature of Addison with the\nsavagery of Swift, the mildness of Miss Austen with the boisterousness\nof Fielding and Smollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes that\nher immediate predecessor, Miss Burney, allowed without very much\nprotest. Yet, both in Mr. Addison and in Miss Austen there is, though a\nrestrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in\nroasting and cutting up a fool. A man in the early eighteenth century,\nof course, could push this taste further than a lady in the early\nnineteenth; and no doubt Miss Austen’s principles, as well as her heart,\nwould have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate\nhusband in the_ Spectator, _who describes, with all the gusto and all the\ninnocence in the world, how his wife and his friend induce him to play\nat blind-man’s-buff. But another_ Spectator _letter--that of the damsel\nof fourteen who wishes to marry Mr. Shapely, and assures her selected\nMentor that “he admires your_ Spectators _mightily”--might have been\nwritten by a rather more ladylike and intelligent Lydia Bennet in the\ndays of Lydia’s great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (I\nthink unreasonably) have found “cynicism” in touches of Miss Austen’s\nown, such as her satire of Mrs. Musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over\nher son. But this word “cynical” is one of the most misused in the\nEnglish language, especially when, by a glaring and gratuitous\nfalsification of its original sense, it is applied, not to rough and\nsnarling invective, but to gentle and oblique satire. If cynicism means\nthe perception of “the other side,” the sense of “the accepted hells\nbeneath,” the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, and\nthat to seem is not identical with to be--if this be cynicism, then\nevery man and woman who is not a fool, who does not care to live in a\nfool’s paradise, who has knowledge of nature and the world and life, is\na cynic. And in that sense Miss Austen certainly was one. She may even\nhave been one in the further sense that, like her own Mr. Bennet, she\ntook an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at\nwork her fools and her mean persons. I think she did take this delight,\nand I do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman, while she\nwas immensely the better for it as an artist._",
      "_In respect of her art generally, Mr. Goldwin Smith has truly observed\nthat “metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it,\ncombined with the narrowness of her field;” and he has justly added that\nwe need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniature\npainter. To make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the\nterm miniature in its restricted sense, and must think rather of Memling\nat one end of the history of painting and Meissonier at the other, than\nof Cosway or any of his kind. And I am not so certain that I should\nmyself use the word “narrow” in connection with her. If her world is a\nmicrocosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the\nlittleness. She does not touch what she did not feel herself called to\npaint; I am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not\nfeel herself called to touch. It is at least remarkable that in two very\nshort periods of writing--one of about three years, and another of not\nmuch more than five--she executed six capital works, and has not left a\nsingle failure. It is possible that the romantic paste in her\ncomposition was defective: we must always remember that hardly\nanybody born in her decade--that of the eighteenth-century\nseventies--independently exhibited the full romantic quality. Even Scott\nrequired hill and mountain and ballad, even Coleridge metaphysics and\nGerman to enable them to chip the classical shell. Miss Austen was an\nEnglish girl, brought up in a country retirement, at the time when\nladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might\npierce their kid shoes, when a sudden cold was the subject of the\ngravest fears, when their studies, their ways, their conduct were\nsubject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which\nMary Wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular\ntaste or judgment. Miss Austen, too, drew back when the white frost\ntouched her shoes; but I think she would have made a pretty good journey\neven in a black one._",
      "_For if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things which\nonly genius knows. The one was humanity, and the other was art. On the\nfirst head she could not make a mistake; her men, though limited, are\ntrue, and her women are, in the old sense, “absolute.” As to art, if she\nhas never tried idealism, her realism is real to a degree which makes\nthe false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive. Take almost any\nFrenchman, except the late M. de Maupassant, and watch him laboriously\npiling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression. You get\nnone; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you can\nshape a real impression out of the rest. But with Miss Austen the\nmyriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic.\nNothing is false; nothing is superfluous. When (to take the present book\nonly) Mr. Collins changed his mind from Jane to Elizabeth “while Mrs.\nBennet was stirring the fire” (and we know_ how _Mrs. Bennet would have\nstirred the fire), when Mr. Darcy “brought his coffee-cup back_\nhimself,” _the touch in each case is like that of Swift--“taller by the\nbreadth of my nail”--which impressed the half-reluctant Thackeray with\njust and outspoken admiration. Indeed, fantastic as it may seem, I\nshould put Miss Austen as near to Swift in some ways, as I have put her\nto Addison in others._",
      "_This Swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears\nnowhere else in the character of the immortal, the ineffable Mr.\nCollins. Mr. Collins is really_ great; _far greater than anything Addison\never did, almost great enough for Fielding or for Swift himself. It has\nbeen said that no one ever was like him. But in the first place,_ he\n_was like him; he is there--alive, imperishable, more real than hundreds\nof prime ministers and archbishops, of “metals, semi-metals, and\ndistinguished philosophers.” In the second place, it is rash, I think,\nto conclude that an actual Mr. Collins was impossible or non-existent at\nthe end of the eighteenth century. It is very interesting that we\npossess, in this same gallery, what may be called a spoiled first\ndraught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in John Dashwood. The\nformality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portrait\nis only half alive, and is felt to be even a little unnatural. Mr.\nCollins is perfectly natural, and perfectly alive. In fact, for all the\n“miniature,” there is something gigantic in the way in which a certain\nside, and more than one, of humanity, and especially eighteenth-century\nhumanity, its Philistinism, its well-meaning but hide-bound morality,\nits formal pettiness, its grovelling respect for rank, its materialism,\nits selfishness, receives exhibition. I will not admit that one speech\nor one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled\nwith reality, and I should not wonder if many of these words and actions\nare historically true._",
      "_But the greatness of Mr. Collins could not have been so satisfactorily\nexhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the\nfigures of Mr. Bennet and of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. The latter, like\nMr. Collins himself, has been charged with exaggeration. There is,\nperhaps, a very faint shade of colour for the charge; but it seems to me\nvery faint indeed. Even now I do not think that it would be impossible\nto find persons, especially female persons, not necessarily of noble\nbirth, as overbearing, as self-centred, as neglectful of good manners,\nas Lady Catherine. A hundred years ago, an earl’s daughter, the Lady\nPowerful (if not exactly Bountiful) of an out-of-the-way country parish,\nrich, long out of marital authority, and so forth, had opportunities of\ndeveloping these agreeable characteristics which seldom present\nthemselves now. As for Mr. Bennet, Miss Austen, and Mr. Darcy, and even\nMiss Elizabeth herself, were, I am inclined to think, rather hard on him\nfor the “impropriety” of his conduct. His wife was evidently, and must\nalways have been, a quite irreclaimable fool; and unless he had shot her\nor himself there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit but\nthe ironic. From no other point of view is he open to any reproach,\nexcept for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of\nthe elopement, and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the\nconsciously humorous kind--in the kind that we laugh with, not at--that\neven Miss Austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters. It is\ndifficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife,\nor when putting Mr. Collins through his paces; but the general sense of\nthe world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank his\nconsolation to the former when she maunders over the entail, “My dear,\ndo not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things.\nLet us flatter ourselves that_ I _may be the survivor;” and his inquiry\nto his colossal cousin as to the compliments which Mr. Collins has just\nrelated as made by himself to Lady Catherine, “May I ask whether these\npleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the\nresult of previous study?” These are the things which give Miss Austen’s\nreaders the pleasant shocks, the delightful thrills, which are felt by\nthe readers of Swift, of Fielding, and we may here add, of Thackeray, as\nthey are felt by the readers of no other English author of fiction\noutside of these four._",
      "_The goodness of the minor characters in_ Pride and Prejudice _has been\nalready alluded to, and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beauties\ndifficult in any space, and impossible in this. Mrs. Bennet we have\nglanced at, and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely\namusing or more horribly true. Much the same may be said of Kitty and\nLydia; but it is not every author, even of genius, who would have\ndifferentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and\nvulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common\nweaknesses of woman at such different ages. With Mary, Miss Austen has\ntaken rather less pains, though she has been even more unkind to her;\nnot merely in the text, but, as we learn from those interesting\ntraditional appendices which Mr. Austen Leigh has given us, in dooming\nher privately to marry “one of Mr. Philips’s clerks.” The habits of\nfirst copying and then retailing moral sentiments, of playing and\nsinging too long in public, are, no doubt, grievous and criminal; but\nperhaps poor Mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings\nin that Fordyce-belectured generation. It is at any rate difficult not\nto extend to her a share of the respect and affection (affection and\nrespect of a peculiar kind; doubtless), with which one regards Mr.\nCollins, when she draws the moral of Lydia’s fall. I sometimes wish\nthat the exigencies of the story had permitted Miss Austen to unite\nthese personages, and thus at once achieve a notable mating and soothe\npoor Mrs. Bennet’s anguish over the entail._",
      "_The Bingleys and the Gardiners and the Lucases, Miss Darcy and Miss de\nBourgh, Jane, Wickham, and the rest, must pass without special comment,\nfurther than the remark that Charlotte Lucas (her egregious papa, though\ndelightful, is just a little on the thither side of the line between\ncomedy and farce) is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind, and\nthat Wickham (though something of Miss Austen’s hesitation of touch in\ndealing with young men appears) is a not much less notable sketch in\ndrab of another. Only genius could have made Charlotte what she is, yet\nnot disagreeable; Wickham what he is, without investing him either with\na cheap Don Juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality. But the\nhero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed._",
      "_Darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting of\nMiss Austen’s heroes; the only possible competitor being Henry Tilney,\nwhose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into\ncomparison. It has sometimes, I believe, been urged that his pride is\nunnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding, while\nhis falling in love at all is not extremely probable. Here again I\ncannot go with the objectors. Darcy’s own account of the way in which\nhis pride had been pampered, is perfectly rational and sufficient; and\nnothing could be, psychologically speaking, a_ causa verior _for its\nsudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of Elizabeth’s\nscornful refusal acting on a nature_ ex hypothesi _generous. Nothing in\neven our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of\nhis demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of Pemberley. Had he\nbeen a bad prig or a bad coxcomb, he might have been still smarting\nunder his rejection, or suspicious that the girl had come\nhusband-hunting. His being neither is exactly consistent with the\nprobable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense, but not really\ninjured in disposition, and thoroughly in love. As for his being in\nlove, Elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that\nphenomenon as Darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state,\nonly she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal\ncharm._",
      "_The secret of that charm many men and not a few women, from Miss Austen\nherself downwards, have felt, and like most charms it is a thing rather\nto be felt than to be explained. Elizabeth of course belongs to the_\nallegro _or_ allegra _division of the army of Venus. Miss Austen was\nalways provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties; and\nexcept the fine eyes, and a hint or two that she had at any rate\nsometimes a bright complexion, and was not very tall, we hear nothing\nabout her looks. But her chief difference from other heroines of the\nlively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly clever--almost\nstrong-minded, in the better sense of that objectionable word--and\nsecondly in her being entirely destitute of ill-nature for all her\npropensity to tease and the sharpness of her tongue. Elizabeth can give\nat least as good as she gets when she is attacked; but she never\n“scratches,” and she never attacks first. Some of the merest\nobsoletenesses of phrase and manner give one or two of her early\nspeeches a slight pertness, but that is nothing, and when she comes to\nserious business, as in the great proposal scene with Darcy (which is,\nas it should be, the climax of the interest of the book), and in the\nfinal ladies’ battle with Lady Catherine, she is unexceptionable. Then\ntoo she is a perfectly natural girl. She does not disguise from herself\nor anybody that she resents Darcy’s first ill-mannered personality with\nas personal a feeling. (By the way, the reproach that the ill-manners of\nthis speech are overdone is certainly unjust; for things of the same\nkind, expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely, might have\nbeen heard in more than one ball-room during this very year from persons\nwho ought to have been no worse bred than Darcy.) And she lets the\ninjury done to Jane and the contempt shown to the rest of her family\naggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the world._",
      "_Still, all this does not explain her charm, which, taking beauty as a\ncommon form of all heroines, may perhaps consist in the addition to her\nplayfulness, her wit, her affectionate and natural disposition, of a\ncertain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her type and age.\nNearly all of them would have been in speechless awe of the magnificent\nDarcy; nearly all of them would have palpitated and fluttered at the\nidea of proposals, even naughty ones, from the fascinating Wickham.\nElizabeth, with nothing offensive, nothing_ viraginous, _nothing of the\n“New Woman” about her, has by nature what the best modern (not “new”)\nwomen have by education and experience, a perfect freedom from the idea\nthat all men may bully her if they choose, and that most will away with\nher if they can. Though not in the least “impudent and mannish grown,”\nshe has no mere sensibility, no nasty niceness about her. The form of\npassion common and likely to seem natural in Miss Austen’s day was so\ninvariably connected with the display of one or the other, or both of\nthese qualities, that she has not made Elizabeth outwardly passionate.\nBut I, at least, have not the slightest doubt that she would have\nmarried Darcy just as willingly without Pemberley as with it, and\nanybody who can read between lines will not find the lovers’\nconversations in the final chapters so frigid as they might have looked\nto the Della Cruscans of their own day, and perhaps do look to the Della\nCruscans of this._",
      "_And, after all, what is the good of seeking for the reason of\ncharm?--it is there. There were better sense in the sad mechanic\nexercise of determining the reason of its absence where it is not. In\nthe novels of the last hundred years there are vast numbers of young\nladies with whom it might be a pleasure to fall in love; there are at\nleast five with whom, as it seems to me, no man of taste and spirit can\nhelp doing so. Their names are, in chronological order, Elizabeth\nBennet, Diana Vernon, Argemone Lavington, Beatrix Esmond, and Barbara\nGrant. I should have been most in love with Beatrix and Argemone; I\nshould, I think, for mere occasional companionship, have preferred Diana\nand Barbara. But to live with and to marry, I do not know that any one\nof the four can come into competition with Elizabeth._\n\n_GEORGE SAINTSBURY._\n\n[Illustration: List of Illustrations.]\n\nPAGE\n\nFrontispiece                                                          iv\n\nTitle-page                                                             v\n\nDedication                                                           vii\n\nHeading to Preface                                                    ix\n\nHeading to List of Illustrations                                     xxv\n\nHeading to Chapter I.                                                  1\n\n“He came down to see the place”                                        2",

      "“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken\nby a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came\ndown on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much\ndelighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is\nto take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be\nin the house by the end of next week.”\n\n“What is his name?”\n\n“Bingley.”\n\n“Is he married or single?”\n\n“Oh, single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or\nfive thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”\n\n“How so? how can it affect them?”\n\n“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome? You\nmust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”\n\n“Is that his design in settling here?”\n\n“Design? Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\n_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\nsoon as he comes.”\n\n“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go--or you may send\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are\nas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the\nparty.”\n\n“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\nI do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five\ngrown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”",
      "“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”\n\n“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into\nthe neighbourhood.”\n\n“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”\n\n“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\nbe for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,\nmerely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new\ncomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit\nhim, if you do not.”\n\n“You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\nglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\nhearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls--though\nI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”\n\n“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\nothers: and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\ngood-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.”\n\n“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he: “they are\nall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\nquickness than her sisters.”\n\n“Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take\ndelight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.”",
      "“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\nare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\nthese twenty years at least.”\n\n“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”\n\n“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\nthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”\n\n“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not\nvisit them.”\n\n“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\nall.”\n\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had\nbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind\nwas less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,\nlittle information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she\nfancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her\ndaughters married: its solace was visiting and news.\n\n[Illustration: M^{r.} & M^{rs.} Bennet\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He\nhad always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his\nwife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was\npaid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following\nmanner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he\nsuddenly addressed her with,--\n\n“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”\n\n“We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother,\nresentfully, “since we are not to visit.”\n\n“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the\nassemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”\n\n“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces\nof her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion\nof her.”\n\n“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do\nnot depend on her serving you.”\n\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain\nherself, began scolding one of her daughters.\n\n“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a little\ncompassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”\n\n“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times\nthem ill.”\n\n“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty, fretfully. “When\nis your next ball to be, Lizzy?”\n\n“To-morrow fortnight.”",
      "“Ay, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till\nthe day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for\nshe will not know him herself.”\n\n“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce\nMr. Bingley to _her_.”\n\n“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him\nmyself; how can you be so teasing?”\n\n“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly\nvery little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a\nfortnight. But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after\nall, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,\nas she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I\nwill take it on myself.”\n\nThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,\nnonsense!”\n\n“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do\nyou consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on\nthem, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,\nMary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read\ngreat books, and make extracts.”\n\nMary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.\n\n“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.\nBingley.”\n\n“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.",
      "“I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did you not tell me so before? If I\nhad known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on\nhim. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we\ncannot escape the acquaintance now.”\n\nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished--that of Mrs.\nBennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy\nwas over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the\nwhile.\n\n“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\npersuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\nneglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! And it is such a\ngood joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a\nword about it till now.”\n\n“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,\nas he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.\n\n“What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the door was\nshut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;\nor me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so\npleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but\nfor your sakes we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_\nthe youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next\nball.”",
      "“Oh,” said Lydia, stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the\nyoungest, I’m the tallest.”\n\nThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would\nreturn Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to\ndinner.\n\n[Illustration: “I’m the tallest”]\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“He rode a black horse”\n]\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nNot all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five\ndaughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her\nhusband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him\nin various ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and\ndistant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at\nlast obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,\nLady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been\ndelighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\nagreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly\nwith a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of\ndancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively\nhopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.\n\n“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”\nsaid Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well\nmarried, I shall have nothing to wish for.”",
      "In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about ten\nminutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being\nadmitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard\nmuch; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more\nfortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper\nwindow, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.\n\nAn invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already had\nMrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her\nhousekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley\nwas obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to\naccept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite\ndisconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town\nso soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that\nhe might always be flying about from one place to another, and never\nsettled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a\nlittle by starting the idea of his\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“When the Party entered”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]",
      "being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a\nreport soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and\nseven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a\nnumber of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing\nthat, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London,\nhis five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the\nassembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: Mr. Bingley, his\ntwo sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.",
      "Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant\ncountenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,\nwith an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely\nlooked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention\nof the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and\nthe report, which was in general circulation within five minutes after\nhis entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen\npronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was\nmuch handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great\nadmiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust\nwhich turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be\nproud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his\nlarge estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding,\ndisagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his\nfriend.",
      "Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal\npeople in the room: he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,\nwas angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one\nhimself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for\nthemselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced\nonly once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being\nintroduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in\nwalking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\nHis character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in\nthe world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.\nAmongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of\nhis general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his\nhaving slighted one of her daughters.\n\nElizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit\ndown for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been\nstanding near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and\nMr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his\nfriend to join it.\n\n“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you\nstanding about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better\ndance.”",
      "“I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am\nparticularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it\nwould be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not\nanother woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to\nstand up with.”\n\n“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley, “for a\nkingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my\nlife as I have this evening; and there are several of them, you see,\nuncommonly pretty.”\n\n“_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.\nDarcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\n\n“Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one\nof her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I\ndare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“She is tolerable”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n“Which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at\nElizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own, and coldly said,\n“She is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no\nhumour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted\nby other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her\nsmiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”",
      "Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth\nremained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story,\nhowever, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,\nplayful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.\n\nThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.\nBennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield\nparty. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been\ndistinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her\nmother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’s\npleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\naccomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\nfortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they\nhad yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\nspirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they\nwere the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a\nbook, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\ngood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised\nsuch splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife’s\nviews on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he\nhad a very different story to hear.",
      "“Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most\ndelightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.\nJane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well\nshe looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with\nher twice. Only think of _that_, my dear: he actually danced with her\ntwice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second\ntime. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand\nup with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody\ncan, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\ndown the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and\nasked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss\nKing, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane\nagain, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_----”\n\n“If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,\n“he would not have danced half so much! For God’s sake, say no more of\nhis partners. O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!”\n\n“Oh, my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him. He\nis so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never\nin my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the\nlace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown----”",
      "Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\ndescription of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch\nof the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some\nexaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\n\n“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not\nsuiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at\nall worth pleasing. So high and so conceited, that there was no enduring\nhim! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very\ngreat! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my\ndear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWhen Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in\nher praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much\nshe admired him.\n\n“He is just what a young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,\ngood-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! so much ease,\nwith such perfect good breeding!”\n\n“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought\nlikewise to be if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”\n\n“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I\ndid not expect such a compliment.”",
      "“Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference between\nus. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What\ncould be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help\nseeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in\nthe room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is\nvery agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a\nstupider person.”\n\n“Dear Lizzy!”\n\n“Oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.\nYou never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable\nin your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.”\n\n“I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak\nwhat I think.”\n\n“I know you do: and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_\ngood sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of\nothers! Affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it\neverywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the\ngood of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing\nof the bad,--belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man’s sisters,\ntoo, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”",
      "“Certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you\nconverse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep\nhis house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming\nneighbour in her.”\n\nElizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at\nthe assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more\nquickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and\nwith a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was\nvery little disposed to approve them. They were, in fact, very fine\nladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the\npower of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.\nThey were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private\nseminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the\nhabit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people\nof rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of\nthemselves and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in\nthe north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their\nmemories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been\nacquired by trade.",
      "Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred\nthousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,\nbut did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and\nsometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a\ngood house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those\nwho best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\nremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to\npurchase.\n\nHis sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but\nthough he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no\nmeans unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had\nmarried a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider\nhis house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of\nage two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to\nlook at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it, for half an\nhour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied\nwith what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.",
      "Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a\ngreat opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the\neasiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition\ncould offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he\nnever appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley\nhad the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In\nunderstanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means\ndeficient; but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,\nreserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not\ninviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley\nwas sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually\ngiving offence.",
      "The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently\ncharacteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier\ngirls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;\nthere had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted\nwith all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel\nmore beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people\nin whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\nfelt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or\npleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too\nmuch.\n\nMrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired\nher and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom\nthey should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore\nestablished as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such\ncommendation to think of her as he chose.\n\n[Illustration: [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets\nwere particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade\nin Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the\nhonour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The\ndistinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. It had given him a\ndisgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town;\nand, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about\na mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; where he\ncould think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by\nbusiness, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For,\nthough elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the\ncontrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive,\nfriendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made him\ncourteous.\n\nLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\nvaluable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest\nof them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was\nElizabeth’s intimate friend.\n\nThat the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a\nball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly\nbrought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.",
      "“_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet, with civil\nself-command, to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.”\n\n“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”\n\n“Oh, you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be\nsure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed, I rather believe he\n_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something\nabout Mr. Robinson.”\n\n“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson: did not\nI mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he liked our Meryton\nassemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty\nwomen in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his\nanswering immediately to the last question, ‘Oh, the eldest Miss Bennet,\nbeyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”\n\n“Upon my word! Well, that was very decided, indeed--that does seem as\nif--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”\n\n“_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,” said\nCharlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,\nis he? Poor Eliza! to be only just _tolerable_.”",
      "“I beg you will not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his\nill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite\na misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he\nsat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.”\n\n[Illustration: “Without once opening his lips”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n“Are you quite sure, ma’am? Is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.\n“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”\n\n“Ay, because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he\ncould not help answering her; but she said he seemed very angry at being\nspoke to.”\n\n“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much unless\namong his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is remarkably\nagreeable.”\n\n“I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very\nagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it\nwas; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had\nheard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had to come\nto the ball in a hack chaise.”\n\n“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I\nwish he had danced with Eliza.”\n\n“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with _him_,\nif I were you.”\n\n“I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.”",
      "“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as pride\noften does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so\nvery fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,\nshould think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_\nto be proud.”\n\n“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive\n_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”\n\n“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her\nreflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have\never read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human\nnature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us\nwho do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some\nquality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different\nthings, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be\nproud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of\nourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.”\n\n“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with his\nsisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of\nfoxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”\n\n“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.\nBennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle\ndirectly.”",
      "The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she\nwould; and the argument ended only with the visit.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit\nwas returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on the\ngood-will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was\nfound to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,\na wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the\ntwo eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest\npleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of\neverybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;\nthough their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising,\nin all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. It\nwas generally evident, whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and\nto _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference\nwhich she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\nway to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it\nwas not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane\nunited with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an\nuniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the\nsuspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend, Miss\nLucas.",
      "“It may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose\non the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be\nso very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill\nfrom the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and\nit will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the\ndark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every\nattachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all\n_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are\nvery few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without\nencouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_\naffection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he\nmay never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”\n\n“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can\nperceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to\ndiscover it too.”\n\n“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”\n\n“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal\nit, he must find it out.”",
      "“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane\nmeet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they\nalways see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that\nevery moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should\ntherefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his\nattention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling\nin love as much as she chooses.”\n\n“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in\nquestion but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined\nto get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But\nthese are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet she\ncannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its\nreasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four\ndances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,\nand has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite\nenough to make her understand his character.”\n\n“Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might\nonly have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must\nremember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four\nevenings may do a great deal.”",
      "“Yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both\nlike Vingt-un better than Commerce, but with respect to any other\nleading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”\n\n“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if\nshe were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a\nchance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a\ntwelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If\nthe dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or\never so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the\nleast. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to\nhave their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as\npossible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your\nlife.”\n\n“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not\nsound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”",
      "Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attention to her sister, Elizabeth\nwas far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some\ninterest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely\nallowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the\nball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no\nsooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had\nhardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\nuncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To\nthis discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had\ndetected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry\nin her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and\npleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those\nof the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of\nthis she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made\nhimself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough\nto dance with.\n\nHe began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing\nwith her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so\ndrew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were\nassembled.",
      "“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my\nconversation with Colonel Forster?”\n\n“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”\n\n“But if he does it any more, I shall certainly let him know that I see\nwhat he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by\nbeing impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”\n\n[Illustration: “The entreaties of several” [_Copyright 1894 by George\nAllen._]]\n\nOn his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have\nany intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such\na subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she\nturned to him and said,--\n\n“Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well\njust now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at\nMeryton?”\n\n“With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady\nenergetic.”\n\n“You are severe on us.”\n\n“It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going\nto open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”",
      "“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me\nto play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a\nmusical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would\nreally rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of\nhearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering, however,\nshe added, “Very well; if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing\nat Mr. Darcy, “There is a very fine old saying, which everybody here is\nof course familiar with--‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’--and\nI shall keep mine to swell my song.”\n\nHer performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song\nor two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she\nwould sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her\nsister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in\nthe family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always\nimpatient for display.",
      "Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her\napplication, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited\nmanner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she\nhad reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with\nmuch more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the\nend of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by\nScotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with\nsome of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in\ndancing at one end of the room.\n\nMr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\npassing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too\nmuch engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas\nwas his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:--\n\n“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is\nnothing like dancing, after all. I consider it as one of the first\nrefinements of polished societies.”\n\n“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst\nthe less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.”\n\nSir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he\ncontinued, after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt\nnot that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”",
      "“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”\n\n“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do\nyou often dance at St. James’s?”\n\n“Never, sir.”\n\n“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”\n\n“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”\n\n“You have a house in town, I conclude?”\n\nMr. Darcy bowed.\n\n“I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for I am fond of\nsuperior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of\nLondon would agree with Lady Lucas.”\n\nHe paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to\nmake any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was\nstruck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to\nher,--\n\n“My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow\nme to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You\ncannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.”\nAnd, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though\nextremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly\ndrew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,--\n\n“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you\nnot to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”",
      "Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of\nher hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at\nall shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.\n\n“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me\nthe happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the\namusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us\nfor one half hour.”\n\n“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.\n\n“He is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we\ncannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a\npartner?”\n\nElizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured\nher with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some\ncomplacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,--\n\n“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”\n\n“I should imagine not.”\n\n“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many\nevenings in this manner,--in such society; and, indeed, I am quite of\nyour opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the\nnoise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these\npeople! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”",
      "“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more\nagreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure\nwhich a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”\n\nMiss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he\nwould tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.\nMr. Darcy replied, with great intrepidity,--\n\n“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”\n\n“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment.\nHow long has she been such a favourite? and pray when am I to wish you\njoy?”\n\n“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady’s\nimagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love\nto matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”\n\n“Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as\nabsolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and\nof course she will be always at Pemberley with you.”\n\nHe listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to\nentertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her\nthat all was safe, her wit flowed along.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“A note for Miss Bennet”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two\nthousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,\nin default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s\nfortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply\nthe deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and\nhad left her four thousand pounds.\n\nShe had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their\nfather and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in\nLondon in a respectable line of trade.",
      "The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most\nconvenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted\nthither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and\nto a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,\nCatherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:\ntheir minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing\nbetter offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning\nhours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of\nnews the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn\nsome from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both\nwith news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in\nthe neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was\nthe head-quarters.",
      "Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting\nintelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the\nofficers’ names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,\nand at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips\nvisited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity\nunknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.\nBingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their\nmother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of\nan ensign.\n\nAfter listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.\nBennet coolly observed,--\n\n“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two\nof the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but\nI am now convinced.”\n\nCatherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect\nindifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and\nher hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the\nnext morning to London.\n\n“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so\nready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly\nof anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”\n\n“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”",
      "“Yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”\n\n“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I\nhad hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must\nso far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly\nfoolish.”\n\n“My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of\ntheir father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will\nnot think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I\nliked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my\nheart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,\nshould want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought\nColonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in\nhis regimentals.”\n\n“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain\nCarter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they first\ncame; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”\n\nMrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a\nnote for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited\nfor an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was\neagerly calling out, while her daughter read,--\n\n“Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,\nJane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”",
      "“It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.\n\n/* NIND “My dear friend, */\n\n“If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and\n     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our\n     lives; for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women can never\n     end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of\n     this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.\n     Yours ever,\n\n“CAROLINE BINGLEY.”\n\n“With the officers!” cried Lydia: “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of\n_that_.”\n\n“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet; “that is very unlucky.”\n\n“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.\n\n“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to\nrain; and then you must stay all night.”\n\n“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that\nthey would not offer to send her home.”\n\n“Oh, but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to Meryton;\nand the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”\n\n“I had much rather go in the coach.”\n\n“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are\nwanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?”\n\n[Illustration: Cheerful prognostics]\n\n“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”\n\n“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose\nwill be answered.”",
      "She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses\nwere engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her\nmother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad\nday. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it\nrained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was\ndelighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;\nJane certainly could not come back.\n\n“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet, more than\nonce, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next\nmorning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her\ncontrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield\nbrought the following note for Elizabeth:--\n\n/* NIND “My dearest Lizzie, */\n\n“I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be\n     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will\n     not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on\n     my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear\n     of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and a\n     headache, there is not much the matter with me.\n\n“Yours, etc.”",
      "“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note\naloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she\nshould die--it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of\nMr. Bingley, and under your orders.”\n\n“Oh, I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little\ntrifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays\nthere, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the\ncarriage.”\n\nElizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the\ncarriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking was\nher only alternative. She declared her resolution.\n\n“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a\nthing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get\nthere.”\n\n“I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.”\n\n“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the\nhorses?”\n\n“No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,\nwhen one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”\n\n“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every\nimpulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,\nexertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”",
      "“We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.\nElizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off\ntogether.\n\n“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may\nsee something of Captain Carter, before he goes.”\n\nIn Meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one\nof the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing\nfield after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing\nover puddles, with impatient activity, and finding herself at last\nwithin view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face\nglowing with the warmth of exercise.",
      "She was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane were\nassembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.\nThat she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such\ndirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and\nMiss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt\nfor it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their\nbrother’s manners there was something better than politeness--there was\ngood-humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst\nnothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the\nbrilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to\nthe occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was\nthinking only of his breakfast.",
      "Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss\nBennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well\nenough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her\nimmediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving\nalarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed\nfor such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,\nhowever, to much conversation; and when Miss Bingley left them together,\ncould attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the\nextraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended\nher.\n\nWhen breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth\nbegan to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and\nsolicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came; and having\nexamined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a\nviolent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;\nadvised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice\nwas followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head\nached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were\nthe other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact\nnothing to do elsewhere.",
      "When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very\nunwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only\nwanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern\nat parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer\nof the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the\npresent. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was\ndespatched to Longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring\nback a supply of clothes.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“The Apothecary came”\n]\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“covering a screen”\n]\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAt five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six\nElizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then\npoured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the\nmuch superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley, she could not make a very\nfavourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing\nthis, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how\nshocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked\nbeing ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their\nindifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restored\nElizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.",
      "Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could\nregard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his\nattentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling\nherself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the\nothers. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was\nengrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.\nHurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to\neat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain\ndish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\n\nWhen dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley\nbegan abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were\npronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence:\nshe had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst\nthought the same, and added,--\n\n“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent\nwalker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really\nlooked almost wild.”\n\n“She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very\nnonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the\ncountry, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”",
      "“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep\nin mud, I am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to\nhide it not doing its office.”\n\n“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was\nall lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well\nwhen she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite\nescaped my notice.”\n\n“_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am\ninclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such\nan exhibition.”\n\n“Certainly not.”\n\n“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,\nabove her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by\nit? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,\na most country-town indifference to decorum.”\n\n“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said\nBingley.\n\n“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,\n“that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine\neyes.”\n\n“Not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” A\nshort pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again,--",
      "“I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet\ngirl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such\na father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no\nchance of it.”\n\n“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in\nMeryton?”\n\n“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”\n\n“That is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.\n\n“If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it\nwould not make them one jot less agreeable.”\n\n“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any\nconsideration in the world,” replied Darcy.\n\nTo this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their\nhearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of\ntheir dear friend’s vulgar relations.",
      "With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on\nleaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.\nShe was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till\nlate in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and\nwhen it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go\ndown stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room, she found the whole\nparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting\nthem to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the\nexcuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay\nbelow, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\n\n“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”\n\n“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great\nreader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”\n\n“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I\nam _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”\n\n“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and\nI hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.”\n\nElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table\nwhere a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her\nothers; all that his library afforded.",
      "“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\ncredit; but I am an idle fellow; and though I have not many, I have more\nthan I ever looked into.”\n\nElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those\nin the room.\n\n“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left\nso small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at\nPemberley, Mr. Darcy!”\n\n“It ought to be good,” he replied: “it has been the work of many\ngenerations.”\n\n“And then you have added so much to it yourself--you are always buying\nbooks.”\n\n“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as\nthese.”\n\n“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\nthat noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be\nhalf as delightful as Pemberley.”\n\n“I wish it may.”\n\n“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\nneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a\nfiner county in England than Derbyshire.”\n\n“With all my heart: I will buy Pemberley itself, if Darcy will sell it.”\n\n“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”\n\n“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\nPemberley by purchase than by imitation.”",
      "Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little\nattention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near\nthe card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest\nsister, to observe the game.\n\n“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley: “will\nshe be as tall as I am?”\n\n“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or\nrather taller.”\n\n“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me\nso much. Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished\nfor her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”\n\n“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience\nto be so very accomplished as they all are.”\n\n“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”\n\n“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and\nnet purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and I am\nsure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without\nbeing informed that she was very accomplished.”",
      "“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has\ntoo much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no\notherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but I am very\nfar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I\ncannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my\nacquaintance that are really accomplished.”\n\n“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.\n\n“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your\nidea of an accomplished woman.”\n\n“Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.”\n\n“Oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really\nesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met\nwith. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,\ndancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all\nthis, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of\nwalking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word\nwill be but half deserved.”\n\n“All this she must possess,” added Darcy; “and to all she must yet add\nsomething more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive\nreading.”\n\n“I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.\nI rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”\n\n“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all\nthis?”",
      "“_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and\napplication, and elegance, as you describe, united.”\n\nMrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her\nimplied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who\nanswered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with\nbitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all\nconversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the\nroom.\n\n“Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is\none of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other\nsex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I daresay, it\nsucceeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”\n\n“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,\n“there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend\nto employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is\ndespicable.”\n\nMiss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\ncontinue the subject.",
      "Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and\nthat she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones’s being sent for\nimmediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could\nbe of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most\neminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so\nunwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled\nthat Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet\nwere not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\ndeclared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,\nhowever, by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief to\nhis feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every\npossible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.\n\n[Illustration:\n\nM^{rs} Bennet and her two youngest girls\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the\nmorning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the\ninquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,\nand some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his\nsisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a\nnote sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her\nown judgment of her situation. The note was immediately despatched, and\nits contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her\ntwo youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.\n\nHad she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been\nvery miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was\nnot alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her\nrestoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She\nwould not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried\nhome; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think\nit at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\nBingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all\nattended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes\nthat Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.",
      "“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be\nmoved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass\na little longer on your kindness.”\n\n“Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am\nsure, will not hear of her removal.”\n\n“You may depend upon it, madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,\n“that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she\nremains with us.”\n\nMrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\n\n“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, I do not\nknow what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a\nvast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is\nalways the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest\ntemper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to\n_her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect\nover that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is\nequal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I\nhope, though you have but a short lease.”\n\n“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I\nshould resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five\nminutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”\n\n“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.",
      "“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.\n\n“Oh yes--I understand you perfectly.”\n\n“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen\nthrough, I am afraid, is pitiful.”\n\n“That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep,\nintricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”\n\n“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in\nthe wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”\n\n“I did not know before,” continued Bingley, immediately, “that you were\na studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”\n\n“Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at\nleast that advantage.”\n\n“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for\nsuch a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and\nunvarying society.”\n\n“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be\nobserved in them for ever.”\n\n“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a\ncountry neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of _that_\ngoing on in the country as in town.”\n\nEverybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,\nturned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete\nvictory over him, continued her triumph,--",
      "“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for\nmy part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal\npleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?”\n\n“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; and\nwhen I am in town, it is pretty much the same. They have each their\nadvantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”\n\n“Ay, that is because you have the right disposition. But that\ngentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing\nat all.”\n\n“Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her\nmother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not\nsuch a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which\nyou must acknowledge to be true.”\n\n“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with\nmany people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few\nneighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”\n\nNothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his\ncountenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards\nMr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of\nsaying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if\nCharlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.",
      "“Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir\nWilliam is, Mr. Bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so\ngenteel and so easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_\nis my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very\nimportant and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.”\n\n“Did Charlotte dine with you?”\n\n“No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For\nmy part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own\nwork; _my_ daughters are brought up differently. But everybody is to\njudge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I\nassure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think\nCharlotte so _very_ plain; but then she is our particular friend.”\n\n“She seems a very pleasant young woman,” said Bingley.",
      "“Oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself\nhas often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boast\nof my own child; but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody\nbetter looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own\npartiality. When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my\nbrother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her, that my\nsister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.\nBut, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he\nwrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.”\n\n“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth, impatiently. “There has\nbeen many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first\ndiscovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”\n\n“I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.\n\n“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is\nstrong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I\nam convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”",
      "Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth\ntremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to\nspeak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.\nBennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to\nJane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was\nunaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be\ncivil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part,\nindeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and\nsoon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of\nher daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to\neach other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the\nyoungest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming\ninto the country to give a ball at Netherfield.",
      "Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion\nand good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose\naffection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high\nanimal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the\nattentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners and her\nown easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was\nvery equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the\nball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be\nthe most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer\nto this sudden attack was delightful to her mother’s ear.\n\n“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and, when\nyour sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of\nthe ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?”\n\nLydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh yes--it would be much better to\nwait till Jane was well; and by that time, most likely, Captain Carter\nwould be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,” she\nadded, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel\nForster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”",
      "Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned\ninstantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the\nremarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,\ncould not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of\nall Miss Bingley’s witticisms on _fine eyes_.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss\nBingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who\ncontinued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, Elizabeth joined\ntheir party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear.\nMr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching\nthe progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by\nmessages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and\nMrs. Hurst was observing their game.\n\nElizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in\nattending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual\ncommendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness\nof his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern\nwith which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was\nexactly in unison with her opinion of each.\n\n“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”\n\nHe made no answer.",
      "“You write uncommonly fast.”\n\n“You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”\n\n“How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a\nyear! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!”\n\n“It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.”\n\n“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”\n\n“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”\n\n“I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend\npens remarkably well.”\n\n“Thank you--but I always mend my own.”\n\n“How can you contrive to write so even?”\n\nHe was silent.\n\n“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,\nand pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful\nlittle design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss\nGrantley’s.”\n\n“Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At\npresent I have not room to do them justice.”\n\n“Oh, it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you\nalways write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”\n\n“They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me\nto determine.”\n\n“It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with\nease cannot write ill.”",
      "“That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her\nbrother, “because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much\nfor words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”\n\n“My style of writing is very different from yours.”\n\n“Oh,” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way\nimaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”\n\n“My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them; by which\nmeans my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”\n\n“Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”\n\n“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of\nhumility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an\nindirect boast.”\n\n“And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?”",
      "“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in\nwriting, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of\nthought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you\nthink at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with\nquickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any\nattention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.\nBennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield\nyou should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of\npanegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very\nlaudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business\nundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”\n\n“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the\nfoolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I\nbelieved what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this\nmoment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless\nprecipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”",
      "“I daresay you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you\nwould be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as\ndependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were\nmounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better stay\ntill next week,’ you would probably do it--you would probably not\ngo--and, at another word, might stay a month.”\n\n“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did\nnot do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much\nmore than he did himself.”\n\n“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my\nfriend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am\nafraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means\nintend; for he would certainly think the better of me if, under such a\ncircumstance, I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I\ncould.”\n\n“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention\nas atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”\n\n“Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter--Darcy must speak for\nhimself.”",
      "“You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,\nbut which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to\nstand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,\nthat the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and\nthe delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering\none argument in favour of its propriety.”\n\n“To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit\nwith you.”\n\n“To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of\neither.”\n\n“You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of\nfriendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make\none readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason\none into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have\nsupposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the\ncircumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\nthereupon. But in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend,\nwhere one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no\nvery great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying\nwith the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”",
      "“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange\nwith rather more precision the degree of importance which is to\nappertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting\nbetween the parties?”\n\n“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not\nforgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more\nweight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure\nyou that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with\nmyself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not\nknow a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions, and in\nparticular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,\nwhen he has nothing to do.”\n\nMr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was\nrather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly\nresented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her\nbrother for talking such nonsense.\n\n“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument,\nand want to silence this.”\n\n“Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss\nBennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very\nthankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”",
      "“What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.\nDarcy had much better finish his letter.”\n\nMr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\n\nWhen that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth\nfor the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to\nthe pianoforte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the\nway, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she\nseated herself.\n\nMrs. Hurst sang with her sister; and while they were thus employed,\nElizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books\nthat lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed\non her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of\nadmiration to so great a man, and yet that he should look at her because\nhe disliked her was still more strange. She could only imagine, however,\nat last, that she drew his notice because there was something about her\nmore wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in\nany other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked\nhim too little to care for his approbation.\n\nAfter playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a\nlively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near\nElizabeth, said to her,--",
      "“Do you not feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an\nopportunity of dancing a reel?”\n\nShe smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some\nsurprise at her silence.\n\n“Oh,” said she, “I heard you before; but I could not immediately\ndetermine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’\nthat you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always\ndelight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of\ntheir premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell\nyou that I do not want to dance a reel at all; and now despise me if you\ndare.”\n\n“Indeed I do not dare.”\n\nElizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his\ngallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her\nmanner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody, and Darcy had\nnever been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really\nbelieved that, were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he\nshould be in some danger.\n\nMiss Bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great\nanxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some\nassistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\n\nShe often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of\ntheir supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.",
      "“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the\nnext day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this\ndesirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;\nand if you can compass it, to cure the younger girls of running after\nthe officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to\ncheck that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,\nwhich your lady possesses.”\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“No, no; stay where you are”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n“Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”\n\n“Oh yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed\nin the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the\njudge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different\nlines. As for your Elizabeth’s picture, you must not attempt to have it\ntaken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”\n\n“It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression; but their\ncolour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be\ncopied.”\n\nAt that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and\nElizabeth herself.\n\n“I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some\nconfusion, lest they had been overheard.\n\n“You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away without\ntelling us that you were coming out.”",
      "Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk\nby herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,\nand immediately said,--\n\n“This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the\navenue.”\n\nBut Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,\nlaughingly answered,--\n\n“No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to\nuncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a\nfourth. Good-bye.”\n\nShe then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of\nbeing at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered\nas to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“Piling up the fire”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWhen the ladies removed after dinner Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and\nseeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room,\nwhere she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of\npleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were\nduring the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers\nof conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment\nwith accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their\nacquaintance with spirit.",
      "But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;\nMiss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had\nsomething to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed\nhimself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst\nalso made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness\nand warmth remained for Bingley’s salutation. He was full of joy and\nattention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she\nshould suffer from the change of room; and she removed, at his desire,\nto the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the\ndoor. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.\nElizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great\ndelight.",
      "When tea was over Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\ncard-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.\nDarcy did not wish for cards, and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open\npetition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the\nsilence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.\nHurst had, therefore, nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the\nsofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book. Miss Bingley did the same;\nand Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and\nrings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with Miss\nBennet.\n\nMiss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.\nDarcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was\nperpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She\ncould not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her\nquestion and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be\namused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the\nsecond volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it\nis to spend an evening in this way! I declare, after all, there is no\nenjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a\nbook! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not\nan excellent library.”",
      "No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and\ncast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing\nher brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly\ntowards him and said,--\n\n“By the bye Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at\nNetherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult\nthe wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not\nsome among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a\npleasure.”\n\n“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he\nchooses, before it begins; but as for the ball, it is quite a settled\nthing, and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send\nround my cards.”\n\n“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were\ncarried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably\ntedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much\nmore rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the\nday.”\n\n“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say; but it would not be\nnear so much like a ball.”",
      "Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about\nthe room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at\nwhom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the\ndesperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and,\nturning to Elizabeth, said,--\n\n“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a\nturn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so\nlong in one attitude.”\n\nElizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley\nsucceeded no less in the real object of her civility: Mr. Darcy looked\nup. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as\nElizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was\ndirectly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that\nhe could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down\nthe room together, with either of which motives his joining them would\ninterfere. What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his\nmeaning--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him.\n\n“Not at all,” was her answer; “but, depend upon it, he means to be\nsevere on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask\nnothing about it.”",
      "Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in\nanything, and persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of his\ntwo motives.\n\n“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon\nas she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of passing\nthe evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret\naffairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures\nappear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, I should be\ncompletely in your way; and if the second, I can admire you much better\nas I sit by the fire.”\n\n“Oh, shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so\nabominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”\n\n“Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “We\ncan all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate\nas you are, you must know how it is to be done.”\n\n“But upon my honour I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has not\nyet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of temper and presence of mind! No,\nno; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose\nourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr.\nDarcy may hug himself.”",
      "“Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an\nuncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would\nbe a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a\nlaugh.”\n\n“Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me credit for more than can be. The\nwisest and best of men,--nay, the wisest and best of their actions,--may\nbe rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a\njoke.”\n\n“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth, “there are such people, but I hope I am\nnot one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies\nand nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own, and I\nlaugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what\nyou are without.”\n\n“Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of\nmy life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong\nunderstanding to ridicule.”\n\n“Such as vanity and pride.”\n\n“Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real\nsuperiority of mind--pride will be always under good regulation.”\n\nElizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\n\n“Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley;\n“and pray what is the result?”\n\n“I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it\nhimself without disguise.”",
      "“No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,\nbut they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch\nfor. It is, I believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the\nconvenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of\nothers so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My\nfeelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper\nwould perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost is lost for\never.”\n\n“_That_ is a failing, indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment\n_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I\nreally cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.”\n\n“There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular\nevil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”\n\n“And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate everybody.”\n\n“And yours,” he replied, with a smile, “is wilfully to misunderstand\nthem.”\n\n“Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a\nconversation in which she had no share. “Louisa, you will not mind my\nwaking Mr. Hurst.”\n\nHer sister made not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was\nopened; and Darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not sorry for\nit. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the\nnext morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for\nthem in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on\nher daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which\nwould exactly finish Jane’s week, could not bring herself to receive\nthem with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at\nleast not to Elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.\nBennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage\nbefore Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley\nand his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very\nwell. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively\nresolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the\ncontrary, of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,\nshe urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately, and at\nlength it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield\nthat morning should be mentioned, and the request made.",
      "The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was\nsaid of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on\nJane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was\nthen sorry that she had proposed the delay; for her jealousy and dislike\nof one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.\n\nThe master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so\nsoon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be\nsafe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where\nshe felt herself to be right.\n\nTo Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence: Elizabeth had been at\nNetherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked; and Miss\nBingley was uncivil to _her_ and more teasing than usual to himself. He\nwisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration\nshould _now_ escape him--nothing that could elevate her with the hope of\ninfluencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea had been\nsuggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight\nin confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke\nten words to her through the whole of Saturday: and though they were at\none time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most\nconscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.",
      "On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost\nall, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth increased at last\nvery rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,\nafter assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to\nsee her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most\ntenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of\nthe whole party in the liveliest spirits.\n\nThey were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet\nwondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much\ntrouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their\nfather, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really\nglad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The\nevening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its\nanimation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and\nElizabeth.",
      "They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human\nnature; and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of\nthreadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information\nfor them of a different sort. Much had been done, and much had been said\nin the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers\nhad dined lately with their uncle; a private had been flogged; and it\nhad actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n[Illustration]\n\n“I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at\nbreakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,\nbecause I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.”\n\n“Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,\nunless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in; and I hope _my_ dinners\nare good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.”\n\n“The person of whom I speak is a gentleman and a stranger.”\n\nMrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled. “A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.\nBingley, I am sure. Why, Jane--you never dropped a word of this--you sly\nthing! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.\nBut--good Lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got\nto-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell. I must speak to Hill this\nmoment.”",
      "“It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom I\nnever saw in the whole course of my life.”\n\nThis roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being\neagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.\n\nAfter amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus\nexplained:--“About a month ago I received this letter, and about a\nfortnight ago I answered it; for I thought it a case of some delicacy,\nand requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who,\nwhen I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he\npleases.”\n\n“Oh, my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.\nPray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing\nin the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own\nchildren; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago\nto do something or other about it.”\n\nJane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.\nThey had often attempted it before: but it was a subject on which Mrs.\nBennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail\nbitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of\nfive daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.",
      "“It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet; “and\nnothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.\nBut if you will listen to his letter, you may, perhaps, be a little\nsoftened by his manner of expressing himself.”\n\n“No, that I am sure I shall not: and I think it was very impertinent of\nhim to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false\nfriends. Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father\ndid before him?”\n\n“Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that\nhead, as you will hear.”\n\n/* RIGHT “Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, _15th October_. */\n\n“Dear Sir,",
      "“The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured\n     father always gave me much uneasiness; and, since I have had the\n     misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the\n     breach: but, for some time, I was kept back by my own doubts,\n     fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be\n     on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be\n     at variance.”--‘There, Mrs. Bennet.’--“My mind, however, is now\n     made up on the subject; for, having received ordination at Easter,\n     I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of\n     the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis\n     de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the\n     valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest\n     endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her\n     Ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies\n     which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman,\n     moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing\n     of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on\n     these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of\n     good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my\n     being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly\n     overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered\n     olive branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the\n     means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to\n     apologize for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make\n     them every possible amends; but of this hereafter. If you should\n     have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself\n     the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday,\n     November 18th, by four o’clock, and shall probably trespass on your\n     hospitality till the Saturday se’nnight following, which I can do\n     without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting\n     to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other\n     clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day. I remain, dear sir,\n     with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your\n     well-wisher and friend,",
      "“WILLIAM COLLINS.”\n\n“At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,”\nsaid Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. “He seems to be a most\nconscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and, I doubt not, will\nprove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so\nindulgent as to let him come to us again.”\n\n“There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however; and, if\nhe is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to\ndiscourage him.”\n\n“Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can mean\nto make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his\ncredit.”\n\nElizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady\nCatherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying\nhis parishioners whenever it were required.\n\n“He must be an oddity, I think,” said she. “I cannot make him out. There\nis something very pompous in his style. And what can he mean by\napologizing for being next in the entail? We cannot suppose he would\nhelp it, if he could. Can he be a sensible man, sir?”\n\n“No, my dear; I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the\nreverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his\nletter which promises well. I am impatient to see him.”",
      "“In point of composition,” said Mary, “his letter does not seem\ndefective. The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I\nthink it is well expressed.”\n\nTo Catherine and Lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any\ndegree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should\ncome in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had\nreceived pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for\ntheir mother, Mr. Collins’s letter had done away much of her ill-will,\nand she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which\nastonished her husband and daughters.",
      "Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great\npoliteness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the\nladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need\nof encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall,\nheavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and\nstately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated\nbefore he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of\ndaughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this\ninstance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not\ndoubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. This\ngallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.\nBennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,--\n\n“You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may\nprove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so\noddly.”\n\n“You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”\n\n“Ah, sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you\nmust confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things,\nI know, are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates\nwill go when once they come to be entailed.”",
      "“I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and\ncould say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing\nforward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come\nprepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but, perhaps,\nwhen we are better acquainted----”\n\nHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each\nother. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s admiration. The\nhall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;\nand his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet’s\nheart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his\nown future property. The dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admired;\nand he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its\ncookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured\nhim, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep a good\ncook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged\npardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared\nherself not at all offended; but he continued to apologize for about a\nquarter of an hour.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n[Illustration]",
      "During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants\nwere withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his\nguest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to\nshine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady\nCatherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his\ncomfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen\nbetter. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him\nto more than usual solemnity of manner; and with a most important aspect\nhe protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a\nperson of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself\nexperienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to\napprove of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of\npreaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,\nand had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of\nquadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many\npeople, he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.\nShe had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she\nmade not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the\nneighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or\ntwo to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to\nmarry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had\nonce paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly\napproved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed\nto suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs.",
      "“That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and I\ndare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies\nin general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?”\n\n“The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane\nfrom Rosings Park, her Ladyship’s residence.”\n\n“I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?”\n\n“She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\nextensive property.”\n\n“Ah,” cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than\nmany girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?”\n\n“She is a most charming young lady, indeed. Lady Catherine herself says\nthat, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the\nhandsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks\nthe young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly\nconstitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many\naccomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of, as I am\ninformed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still\nresides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends\nto drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”\n\n“Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at\ncourt.”",
      "“Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;\nand by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived\nthe British Court of its brightest ornament. Her Ladyship seemed pleased\nwith the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to\noffer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to\nladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her\ncharming daughter seemed born to be a duchess; and that the most\nelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by\nher. These are the kind of little things which please her Ladyship, and\nit is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to\npay.”\n\n“You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet; “and it is happy for you\nthat you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask\nwhether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the\nmoment, or are the result of previous study?”\n\n“They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time; and though I\nsometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant\ncompliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to\ngive them as unstudied an air as possible.”",
      "Mr. Bennet’s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd\nas he had hoped; and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,\nmaintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,\nand, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner\nin his pleasure.\n\nBy tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad\nto take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over,\nglad to invite him\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“Protested\nthat he never read novels”      H.T Feb 94\n]\n\nto read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book\nwas produced; but on beholding it (for everything announced it to be\nfrom a circulating library) he started back, and, begging pardon,\nprotested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and Lydia\nexclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he\nchose “Fordyce’s Sermons.” Lydia gaped as he opened the volume; and\nbefore he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she\ninterrupted him with,--\n\n“Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away\nRichard? and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me\nso herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more\nabout it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.”",
      "Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.\nCollins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,--\n\n“I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books\nof a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes\nme, I confess; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to\nthem as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.”\n\nThen, turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at\nbackgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted\nvery wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs.\nBennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for Lydia’s\ninterruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would\nresume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his\nyoung cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any\naffront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared\nfor backgammon.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had\nbeen but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of\nhis life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and\nmiserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he\nhad merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful\nacquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had\ngiven him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good\ndeal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in\nretirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected\nprosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de\nBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he\nfelt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,\nmingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a\nclergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of\npride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.",
      "Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to\nmarry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had\na wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found\nthem as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.\nThis was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father’s\nestate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and\nsuitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own\npart.\n\nHis plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet’s lovely face\nconfirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what\nwas due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled\nchoice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter\nof an hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a\nconversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally\nto the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at\nLongbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general\nencouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. “As to\nher _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could\nnot positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her\n_eldest_ daughter she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to\nhint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”",
      "Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon\ndone--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally\nnext to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.\n\nMrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have\ntwo daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of\nthe day before, was now high in her good graces.\n\nLydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten: every sister\nexcept Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,\nat the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,\nand have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed\nhim after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with\none of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.\nBennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such\ndoings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been\nalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told\nElizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the\nhouse, he was used to be free from them there: his civility, therefore,\nwas most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their\nwalk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker\nthan a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and\ngo.",
      "In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\ncousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of\nthe younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_. Their eyes\nwere immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, and\nnothing less than a very smart bonnet, indeed, or a really new muslin in\na shop window, could recall them.",
      "But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom\nthey had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking\nwith an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very\nMr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and\nhe bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger’s air, all\nwondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible\nto find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting\nsomething in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the\npavement, when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same\nspot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to\nintroduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day\nbefore from town, and, he was happy to say, had accepted a commission in\ntheir corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted\nonly regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was\ngreatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a fine\ncountenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction\nwas followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a\nreadiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the\nwhole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,\nwhen the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were\nseen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group\nthe two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual\ncivilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the\nprincipal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on\npurpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and\nwas beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they\nwere suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and Elizabeth\nhappening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,\nwas all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,\none looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,\ntouched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.\nWhat could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was\nimpossible not to long to know.",
      "In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what\npassed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\n\nMr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of\nMr. Philips’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia’s\npressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.\nPhilips’s throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the\ninvitation.",
      "Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from\ntheir recent absence, were particularly welcome; and she was eagerly\nexpressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own\ncarriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if\nshe had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shopboy in the street, who had\ntold her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield,\nbecause the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed\ntowards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him. She received him with\nher very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,\napologizing for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with\nher, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be\njustified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to\nher notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good\nbreeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to\nby exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she\ncould only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had\nbrought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant’s\ncommission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the last hour,\nshe said, as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickham\nappeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation;\nbut unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the\nofficers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,\ndisagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the\nnext day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.\nWickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\nwould come in the evening. This was agreed to; and Mrs. Philips\nprotested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\ntickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such\ndelights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.\nCollins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured,\nwith unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless.",
      "As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass\nbetween the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or\nboth, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such\nbehaviour than her sister.\n\nMr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.\nPhilips’s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady\nCatherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for\nshe had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even\npointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although\nutterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be\nattributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so\nmuch attention in the whole course of his life.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAs no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with their\naunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for\na single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach\nconveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the\ngirls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,\nthat Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in\nthe house.",
      "When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.\nCollins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much\nstruck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he\nmight almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour\nat Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much\ngratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings\nwas, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the\ndescription of only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found\nthat the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all\nthe force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison\nwith the housekeeper’s room.",
      "In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,\nwith occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the\nimprovements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the\ngentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive\nlistener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she\nheard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as\nsoon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,\nand who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine\ntheir own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, the\ninterval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.\nThe gentlemen did approach: and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,\nElizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking\nof him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The\nofficers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,\ngentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party; but\nMr, Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and\nwalk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,\nbreathing port wine, who followed them into the room.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“The officers of the ----shire”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]",
      "Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was\nturned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated\nhimself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into\nconversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the\nprobability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,\ndullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the\nskill of the speaker.\n\nWith such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the\nofficers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young\nladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind\nlistener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly\nsupplied with coffee and muffin.\n\nWhen the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her,\nin return, by sitting down to whist.\n\n“I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad to\nimprove myself; for in my situation of life----” Mrs. Philips was very\nthankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.",
      "Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\nreceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there\nseemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most\ndetermined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,\nshe soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets\nand exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular.\nAllowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore\nat leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,\nthough what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told,\nthe history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even\nmention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly\nrelieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far\nNetherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in\na hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.\n\n“About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject\ndrop, added, “he is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I\nunderstand.”",
      "“Yes,” replied Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten\nthousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of\ngiving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been\nconnected with his family, in a particular manner, from my infancy.”\n\nElizabeth could not but look surprised.\n\n“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after\nseeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting\nyesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”\n\n“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth, warmly. “I have spent\nfour days in the same house with him, and I think him very\ndisagreeable.”\n\n“I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being\nagreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him\ntoo long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to\nbe impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general\nastonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly\nanywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”\n\n“Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the\nneighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in\nHertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find\nhim more favourably spoken of by anyone.”",
      "“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short\ninterruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond\ntheir deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The\nworld is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his\nhigh and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”\n\n“I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an\nill-tempered man.”\n\nWickham only shook his head.\n\n“I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is\nlikely to be in this country much longer.”\n\n“I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I\nwas at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will\nnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”",
      "“Oh no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_\nwishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go. We are not on friendly terms,\nand it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\navoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world--a sense of\nvery great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.\nHis father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men\nthat ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be\nin company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\nthousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been\nscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\neverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the\nmemory of his father.”\n\nElizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with\nall her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.\n\nMr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\nneighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he\nhad yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but\nvery intelligible gallantry.",
      "“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added,\n“which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I know it to be a\nmost respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend Denny tempted me\nfurther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great\nattentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.\nSociety, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and\nmy spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.\nA military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have\nnow made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I\nwas brought up for the church; and I should at this time have been in\npossession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we\nwere speaking of just now.”\n\n“Indeed!”\n\n“Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best\nliving in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.\nI cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,\nand thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\nelsewhere.”\n\n“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? How could his\nwill be disregarded? Why did not you seek legal redress?”",
      "“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\ngive me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the\nintention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\nconditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\nto it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.\nCertain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I\nwas of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\nless certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\nanything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm unguarded temper, and I\nmay perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too\nfreely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very\ndifferent sort of men, and that he hates me.”\n\n“This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”\n\n“Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I\ncan forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”\n\nElizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than\never as he expressed them.\n\n“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? what can\nhave induced him to behave so cruelly?”",
      "“A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but\nattribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me\nless, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon\nattachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had\nnot a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort\nof preference which was often given me.”\n\n“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\nhim, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be\ndespising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\ndescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as\nthis!”\n\nAfter a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_\nremember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of\nhis resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition\nmust be dreadful.”\n\n“I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “_I_ can\nhardly be just to him.”",
      "Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To\ntreat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his\nfather!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like _you_, whose very\ncountenance may vouch for your being amiable.” But she contented herself\nwith--“And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from\nchildhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest\nmanner.”\n\n“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest\npart of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house,\nsharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_\nfather began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,\nappears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use\nto the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the\nPemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\nintimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to\nbe under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence;\nand when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\nvoluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it\nto be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself.”",
      "“How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! I wonder that the very\npride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you. If from no better\nmotive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for\ndishonesty I must call it.”\n\n“It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham; “for almost all his actions may be\ntraced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend. It has\nconnected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none\nof us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger\nimpulses even than pride.”\n\n“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”\n\n“Yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money\nfreely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the\npoor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his\nfather was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to\ndegenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the\nPemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,\nwhich, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and\ncareful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up\nas the most attentive and best of brothers.”\n\n“What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?”",
      "He shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to\nspeak ill of a Darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very\nproud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond\nof me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is\nnothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,\nand, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father’s death her\nhome has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her\neducation.”\n\nAfter many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not\nhelp reverting once more to the first, and saying,--\n\n“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley. How can Mr. Bingley,\nwho seems good-humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,\nbe in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you\nknow Mr. Bingley?”\n\n“Not at all.”\n\n“He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.\nDarcy is.”",
      "“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not\nwant abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth\nhis while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a\nvery different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride\nnever deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,\nsincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing\nsomething for fortune and figure.”\n\nThe whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round\nthe other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin\nElizabeth and Mrs. Philips. The usual inquiries as to his success were\nmade by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;\nbut when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured\nher, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance;\nthat he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not\nmake herself uneasy.\n\n“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a\ncard table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I\nam not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There\nare, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to Lady\nCatherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding\nlittle matters.”",
      "Mr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for\na few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations\nwere very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh.\n\n“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him a\nliving. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her\nnotice, but he certainly has not known her long.”\n\n“You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy\nwere sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.”\n\n“No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine’s\nconnections. I never heard of her existence till the day before\nyesterday.”\n\n“Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is\nbelieved that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”\n\nThis information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss\nBingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her\naffection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already\nself-destined to another.\n\n“Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her\ndaughter; but, from some particulars that he has related of her\nLadyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that, in spite of\nher being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”",
      "“I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I have\nnot seen her for many years; but I very well remember that I never liked\nher, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the\nreputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe\nshe derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from\nher authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who\nchooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of\nthe first class.”",
      "Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and\nthey continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put\nan end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.\nWickham’s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of\nMrs. Philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to\neverybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done\ngracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could\nthink of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all\nthe way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as\nthey went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia\ntalked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the\nfish she had won; and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and\nMrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses\nat whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing\nthat he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage\nbefore the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“delighted to see their dear friend again”\n]\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "Elizabeth related to Jane, the next day, what had passed between Mr.\nWickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern: she\nknew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.\nBingley’s regard; and yet it was not in her nature to question the\nveracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The\npossibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to\ninterest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be\ndone but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and\nthrow into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be\notherwise explained.\n\n“They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way or\nother, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps\nmisrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to\nconjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,\nwithout actual blame on either side.”\n\n“Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in\nbehalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the\nbusiness? Do clear _them_, too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of\nsomebody.”",
      "“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my\nopinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light\nit places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such a\nmanner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is\nimpossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his\ncharacter, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so\nexcessively deceived in him? Oh no.”\n\n“I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on than that\nMr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last\nnight; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not\nso, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.”\n\n“It is difficult, indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to\nthink.”\n\n“I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think.”\n\nBut Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.\nBingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when\nthe affair became public.",
      "The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this\nconversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom\nthey had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their\npersonal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was\nfixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see\ntheir dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and\nrepeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their\nseparation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention;\navoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,\nand nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from\ntheir seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and\nhurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.",
      "The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every\nfemale of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in\ncompliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by\nreceiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a\nceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the\nsociety of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and\nElizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.\nWickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s look\nand behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended\nless on any single event, or any particular person; for though they\neach, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,\nhe was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball\nwas, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she\nhad no disinclination for it.\n\n“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough. I\nthink it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.\nSociety has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who\nconsider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for\neverybody.”",
      "Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did\nnot often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking\nhim whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s invitation, and if he\ndid, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening’s\namusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no\nscruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke,\neither from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to\ndance.\n\n“I am by no means of opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball of\nthis kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can\nhave any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing\nmyself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair\ncousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of\nsoliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially; a\npreference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right\ncause, and not to any disrespect for her.”",
      "Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being\nengaged by Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins\ninstead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no help\nfor it, however. Mr. Wickham’s happiness and her own was perforce\ndelayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted with as\ngood a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his\ngallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first\nstruck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of\nbeing the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a\nquadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.\nThe idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing\ncivilities towards herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a\ncompliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than\ngratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before\nher mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage\nwas exceedingly agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose\nto take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\nconsequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and,\ntill he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.",
      "If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the\nyounger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time;\nfor, from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball, there was\nsuch a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No\naunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; the very shoe-roses\nfor Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some\ntrial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement\nof her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on\nTuesday could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday\nendurable to Kitty and Lydia.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in\nvain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a\ndoubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of\nmeeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that\nmight not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than\nusual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all\nthat remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than\nmight be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the\ndreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for Mr. Darcy’s\npleasure, in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though this\nwas not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was\npronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and\nwho told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business\nthe day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant\nsmile,--\n\n“I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if\nhe had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.”",
      "This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by\nElizabeth; and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for\nWickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling\nof displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate\ndisappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to\nthe polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.\nAttention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She\nwas resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away\nwith a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in\nspeaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.",
      "But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect\nof her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her\nspirits; and, having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she\nhad not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary\ntransition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her\nparticular notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of\ndistress: they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and\nsolemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong\nwithout being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a\ndisagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her\nrelease from him was ecstasy.\n\nShe danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of\nWickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances\nwere over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with\nher, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took\nher so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without\nknowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again\nimmediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of\nmind: Charlotte tried to console her.\n\n“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”",
      "“Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find\na man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an\nevil.”\n\nWhen the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her\nhand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a\nsimpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant\nin the eyes of a man often times his consequence. Elizabeth made no\nanswer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which\nshe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and\nreading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it.\nThey stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to\nimagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at\nfirst, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it\nwould be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk,\nshe made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again\nsilent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time,\nwith--\n\n“It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the\ndance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the\nroom, or the number of couples.”\n\nHe smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be\nsaid.",
      "“Very well; that reply will do for the present. Perhaps, by-and-by, I\nmay observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but\n_now_ we may be silent.”\n\n“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”\n\n“Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be\nentirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of\n_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the\ntrouble of saying as little as possible.”\n\n“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\nimagine that you are gratifying mine?”\n\n“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great\nsimilarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,\ntaciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\nsomething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to\nposterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”\n\n“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,”\nsaid he. “How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_\nthink it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”\n\n“I must not decide on my own performance.”",
      "He made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down\nthe dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often\nwalk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist\nthe temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just\nbeen forming a new acquaintance.”\n\nThe effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his\nfeatures, but he said not a word; and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\nfor her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a\nconstrained manner said,--\n\n“Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his\n_making_ friends; whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,\nis less certain.”\n\n“He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied Elizabeth,\nwith emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all\nhis life.”\n\nDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At\nthat moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\nthrough the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving Mr.\nDarcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on\nhis dancing and his partner.",
      "“I have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very\nsuperior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the\nfirst circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\ndisgrace you: and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\nespecially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancing\nat her sister and Bingley), shall take place. What congratulations will\nthen flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you, sir.\nYou will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of\nthat young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“Such very superior dancing is not\noften seen.”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\nThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir\nWilliam’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his\neyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards Bingley and\nJane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,\nhe turned to his partner, and said,--\n\n“Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we were talking\nof.”\n\n“I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have\ninterrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for\nthemselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success,\nand what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”",
      "“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.\n\n“Books--oh no!--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\nfeelings.”\n\n“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\nno want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.”\n\n“No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of\nsomething else.”\n\n“The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,\nwith a look of doubt.\n\n“Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said; for her\nthoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared\nby her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,\nthat you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment, once created, was\nunappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being\ncreated_?”\n\n“I am,” said he, with a firm voice.\n\n“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”\n\n“I hope not.”\n\n“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,\nto be secure of judging properly at first.”\n\n“May I ask to what these questions tend?”\n\n“Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring\nto shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.”\n\n“And what is your success?”\n\nShe shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such different\naccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”",
      "“I can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary\ngreatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were\nnot to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to\nfear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”\n\n“But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\nopportunity.”\n\n“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.\nShe said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in\nsilence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for\nin Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her,\nwhich soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against\nanother.\n\nThey had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and,\nwith an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,--",
      "“So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham?\nYour sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand\nquestions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his\nother communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr.\nDarcy’s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give\nimplicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to Mr. Darcy’s using\nhim ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been always\nremarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a\nmost infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very\nwell that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bear\nto hear George Wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he\ncould not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he\nwas excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.\nHis coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and\nI wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this\ndiscovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering his\ndescent, one could not expect much better.”",
      "“His guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,”\nsaid Elizabeth, angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing\nworse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of _that_, I can\nassure you, he informed me himself.”\n\n“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.\n“Excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.”\n\n“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken if\nyou expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see\nnothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.\nDarcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make\ninquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of\nsuch sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently\nmarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.\nElizabeth instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude\nfor Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave\nway before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.\n\n“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\nsister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have\nbeen too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case\nyou may be sure of my pardon.”",
      "“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\nsatisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his\nhistory, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\nprincipally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,\nthe probity and honour, of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that\nMr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has\nreceived; and I am sorry to say that by his account, as well as his\nsister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am\nafraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s\nregard.”\n\n“Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself.”\n\n“No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”\n\n“This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am\nperfectly satisfied. But what does he say of the living?”\n\n“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard\nthem from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to\nhim _conditionally_ only.”",
      "“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly,\n“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.\nBingley’s defence of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but\nsince he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt\nthe rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of\nboth gentlemen as I did before.”\n\nShe then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on\nwhich there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with\ndelight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of\nBingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence\nin it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew\nto Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last\npartner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,\nand told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunate\nas to make a most important discovery.",
      "“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now\nin the room a near relation to my patroness. I happened to overhear the\ngentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of\nthis house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh, and of her mother,\nLady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would\nhave thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de\nBourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made\nin time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,\nand trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total\nignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”\n\n“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?”\n\n“Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.\nI believe him to be Lady Catherine’s _nephew_. It will be in my power to\nassure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”",
      "Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him\nthat Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as\nan impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it\nwas not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either\nside, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in\nconsequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with\nthe determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased\nspeaking, replied thus,--",
      "“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your\nexcellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your\nunderstanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference\nbetween the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those\nwhich regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider\nthe clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank\nin the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the\nsame time maintained. You must, therefore, allow me to follow the\ndictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead me to perform\nwhat I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by\nyour advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,\nthough in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education\nand habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like\nyourself;” and with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose\nreception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at\nbeing so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with\na solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if\nhearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,”\n“Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see him\nexpose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with\nunrestrained wonder; and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him to speak,\nreplied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not\ndiscouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed\nabundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the\nend of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way: Mr.\nCollins then returned to Elizabeth.",
      "“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my\nreception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered\nme with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,\nthat he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be\ncertain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very\nhandsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”",
      "As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned\nher attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the\ntrain of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made\nher perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that\nvery house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could\nbestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring\neven to like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts she plainly\nsaw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her,\nlest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore,\nshe considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within\none of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was\ntalking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing\nelse but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr.\nBingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable\nof fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such\na charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them,\nwere the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a\ncomfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be\ncertain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It\nwas, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as\nJane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men;\nand, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to\nconsign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might\nnot be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary\nto make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such\noccasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.\nBennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She\nconcluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally\nfortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no\nchance of it.",
      "In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s\nwords, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible\nwhisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the\nchief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her\nmother only scolded her for being nonsensical.\n\n“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am\nsure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say\nnothing _he_ may not like to hear.”\n\n“For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be to you\nto offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by\nso doing.”\n\nNothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would\ntalk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and\nblushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently\nglancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what\nshe dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was\nconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression\nof his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\nsteady gravity.",
      "At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who\nhad been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no\nlikelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.\nElizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of\ntranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she\nhad the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\npreparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent\nentreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of\ncomplaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an\nopportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.\nElizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and\nshe watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience\nwhich was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving\namongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be\nprevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute\nbegan another. Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display;\nher voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies.\nShe looked at Jane to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly\ntalking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making\nsigns of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,\nimpenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his\ninterference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,\nand, when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,--",
      "“That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.\nLet the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”\n\nMary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and\nElizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid\nher anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.",
      "“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I\nshould have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an\nair; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly\ncompatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,\nto assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to\nmusic, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The\nrector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such\nan agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not\noffensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time\nthat remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\nand improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making\nas comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance\nthat he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards\neverybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I\ncannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who\nshould omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody\nconnected with the family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded\nhis speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the\nroom. Many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.\nBennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for\nhaving spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to Lady\nLucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.",
      "To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to\nexpose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would\nhave been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or\nfiner success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister\nthat some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his\nfeelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he\nmust have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should\nhave such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and\nshe could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or\nthe insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.",
      "The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by\nMr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he\ncould not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her\npower to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with\nsomebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the\nroom. He assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent\nto it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend\nhimself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining\nclose to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a\nproject. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who\noften joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation\nto herself.\n\nShe was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy’s further notice:\nthough often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\ndisengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the\nprobable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in\nit.",
      "The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a\nmanœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an\nhour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how\nheartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her\nsister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and\nwere evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed\nevery attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a\nlanguor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long\nspeeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his\nsisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and\npoliteness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said\nnothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.\nMr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the\nrest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a\nsilence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too\nmuch fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord,\nhow tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.",
      "When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly\ncivil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and\naddressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy\nhe would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,\nwithout the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful\npleasure; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of\nwaiting on her after his return from London, whither he was obliged to\ngo the next day for a short time.\n\nMrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the\ndelightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of\nsettlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly\nsee her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four\nmonths. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought\nwith equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.\nElizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the\nman and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each\nwas eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“to assure you in the most animated language”\n]\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his\ndeclaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as\nhis leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having\nno feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the\nmoment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the\nobservances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding\nMrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon\nafter breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,--\n\n“May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,\nwhen I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the\ncourse of this morning?”\n\nBefore Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.\nBennet instantly answered,--\n\n“Oh dear! Yes, certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure\nshe can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.” And\ngathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth\ncalled out,--\n\n“Dear ma’am, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse\nme. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am\ngoing away myself.”",
      "“No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you will stay where you are.” And\nupon Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about\nto escape, she added, “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing\nMr. Collins.”\n\nElizabeth would not oppose such an injunction; and a moment’s\nconsideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it\nover as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried\nto conceal, by incessant employment, the feelings which were divided\nbetween distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as\nsoon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began,--",
      "“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from\ndoing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You\nwould have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little\nunwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected\nmother’s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport\nof my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to\ndissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as\nsoon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my\nfuture life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this\nsubject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for\nmarrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design\nof selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”\n\nThe idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away\nwith by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not\nuse the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and\nhe continued,--",
      "“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for\nevery clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example\nof matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced it will add\nvery greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps I ought to\nhave mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and\nrecommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling\npatroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked\ntoo!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I\nleft Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was\narranging Miss De Bourgh’s footstool,--that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you\nmust marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a\ngentlewoman for _my_ sake, and for your _own_; let her be an active,\nuseful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small\nincome go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as\nyou can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the\nway, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and\nkindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\nadvantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond\nanything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be\nacceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect\nwhich her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\nintention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\nwere directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I\nassure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that\nbeing, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\nfather (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy\nmyself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that\nthe loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy\nevent takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be\nfor several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I\nflatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing\nremains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\nviolence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\nshall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\naware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\nin the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother’s\ndecease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,\ntherefore, I shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself that\nno ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”",
      "It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\n\n“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made no\nanswer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for\nthe compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of\nyour proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline\nthem.”\n\n“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the\nhand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the\nman whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their\nfavour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a\nthird time. I am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have\njust said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”\n\n“Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is rather an\nextraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not\none of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so\ndaring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second\ntime. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_\nhappy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who\nwould make _you_ so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I\nam persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the\nsituation.”",
      "“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins,\nvery gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her Ladyship would at all\ndisapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of\nseeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,\neconomy, and other amiable qualifications.”\n\n“Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must\ngive me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of\nbelieving what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by\nrefusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.\nIn making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your\nfeelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\nestate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be\nconsidered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she thus\nspoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus\naddressed her,--",
      "“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I\nshall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given\nme; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I\nknow it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the\nfirst application, and, perhaps, you have even now said as much to\nencourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the\nfemale character.”\n\n“Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth, with some warmth, “you puzzle me\nexceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form\nof encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as\nmay convince you of its being one.”",
      "“You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\nrefusal of my addresses are merely words of course. My reasons for\nbelieving it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand\nis unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer\nwould be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my\nconnections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your\nown, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into\nfurther consideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is\nby no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.\nYour portion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo\nthe effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must,\ntherefore, conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I\nshall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by\nsuspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”",
      "“I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind\nof elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would\nrather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you\nagain and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but\nto accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect\nforbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant\nfemale intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the\ntruth from her heart.”\n\n“You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward\ngallantry; “and I am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the express\nauthority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of\nbeing acceptable.”\n\nTo such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no\nreply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, that if he\npersisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering\nencouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered\nin such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could\nnot be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\nsuccessful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule\nto watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the\ndoor and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she\nentered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in\nwarm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins\nreceived and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\nproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result\nof which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the\nrefusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow\nfrom her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.\n\nThis information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet: she would have been\nglad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage\nhim by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,\nand could not help saying so.\n\n“But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be\nbrought to reason. I will speak to her about it myself directly. She is\na very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but\nI will _make_ her know it.”",
      "“Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if she\nis really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would\naltogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who\nnaturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If, therefore, she\nactually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to\nforce her into accepting me, because, if liable to such defects of\ntemper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”\n\n“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. “Lizzy is\nonly headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as\ngood-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and\nwe shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”\n\nShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her\nhusband, called out, as she entered the library,--\n\n“Oh, Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.\nYou must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will\nnot have him; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and\nnot have _her_.”\n\nMr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them\non her face with a calm unconcern, which was not in the least altered by\nher communication.\n\n“I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she had\nfinished her speech. “Of what are you talking?”",
      "“Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,\nand Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.”\n\n“And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems a hopeless business.”\n\n“Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her\nmarrying him.”\n\n“Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.”\n\nMrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the\nlibrary.\n\n“Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “I have sent for\nyou on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made\nyou an offer of marriage. Is it true?”\n\nElizabeth replied that it was.\n\n“Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?”\n\n“I have, sir.”\n\n“Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your\naccepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”\n\n“Yes, or I will never see her again.”\n\n“An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must\nbe a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you\nagain if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again\nif you _do_.”\n\nElizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;\nbut Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the\naffair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.\n\n“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way? You promised me\nto _insist_ upon her marrying him.”",
      "“My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request.\nFirst, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the\npresent occasion; and, secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the\nlibrary to myself as soon as may be.”\n\nNot yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did\nMrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;\ncoaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in\nher interest, but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined\ninterfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and\nsometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner\nvaried, however, her determination never did.\n\nMr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.\nHe thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin\ncould refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other\nway. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her\ndeserving her mother’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.",
      "While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend\nthe day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to\nher, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such\nfun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has\nmade an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.”\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“they entered the breakfast room”\n]\n\nCharlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by Kitty,\nwho came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the\nbreakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on\nthe subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating\nher to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of her\nfamily. “Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,” she added, in a melancholy tone;\n“for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me; I am cruelly used,\nnobody feels for my poor nerves.”\n\nCharlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.",
      "“Ay, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned as\nmay be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she\ncan have her own way. But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it\ninto your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,\nyou will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is\nto maintain you when your father is dead. _I_ shall not be able to keep\nyou--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told\nyou in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,\nand you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking\nto undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking\nto anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have\nno great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it\nis always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.”\n\nHer daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any\nattempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation.\nShe talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till\nthey were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately\nthan usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,--\n\n“Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and\nlet Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together.”",
      "Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but\nLydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,\ndetained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after\nherself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little\ncuriosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending\nnot to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected\nconversation:--\n\n“Oh, Mr. Collins!”",
      "“My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this point.\nFar be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that marked his\ndispleasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to\ninevitable evils is the duty of us all: the peculiar duty of a young man\nwho has been so fortunate as I have been, in early preferment; and, I\ntrust, I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my\npositive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I\nhave often observed, that resignation is never so perfect as when the\nblessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.\nYou will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your\nfamily, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your\ndaughter’s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the\ncompliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.\nMy conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my\ndismission from your daughter’s lips instead of your own; but we are all\nliable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.\nMy object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due\nconsideration for the advantage of all your family; and if my _manner_\nhas been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologize.”\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "The discussion of Mr. Collins’s offer was now nearly at an end, and\nElizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily\nattending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.\nAs for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not\nby embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by\nstiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to\nher; and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of\nhimself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose\ncivility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and\nespecially to her friend.\n\nThe morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill humour or ill\nhealth. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth\nhad hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did\nnot appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on\nSaturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.",
      "After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton, to inquire if Mr. Wickham\nwere returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.\nHe joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their\naunt’s, where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were\nwell talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged\nthat the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.\n\n“I found,” said he, “as the time drew near, that I had better not meet\nMr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so\nmany hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes\nmight arise unpleasant to more than myself.”\n\nShe highly approved his forbearance; and they had leisure for a full\ndiscussion of it, and for all the commendations which they civilly\nbestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with\nthem to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her.\nHis accompanying them was a double advantage: she felt all the\ncompliment it offered to herself; and it was most acceptable as an\noccasion of introducing him to her father and mother.\n\n[Illustration: “Walked back with them”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]",
      "Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came\nfrom Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a\nsheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s\nfair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as\nshe read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.\nJane recollected herself soon; and putting the letter away, tried to\njoin, with her usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation: but\nElizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention\neven from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,\nthan a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs. When they\nhad gained their own room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, “This is\nfrom Caroline Bingley: what it contains has surprised me a good deal.\nThe whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way\nto town; and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear\nwhat she says.”",
      "She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information\nof their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,\nand of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street, where Mr.\nHurst had a house. The next was in these words:--“‘I do not pretend to\nregret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society, my\ndearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many\nreturns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the\nmeanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most\nunreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.’” To these\nhigh-flown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of\ndistrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she\nsaw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that their\nabsence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as\nto the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon\ncease to regard it in the enjoyment of his.",
      "“It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be\nable to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not\nhope that the period of future happiness, to which Miss Bingley looks\nforward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful\nintercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater\nsatisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by\nthem.”\n\n“Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\nHertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you.\n\n“‘When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which\ntook him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we\nare certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when\nCharles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have\ndetermined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend\nhis vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are\nalready there for the winter: I wish I could hear that you, my dearest\nfriend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that I\ndespair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in\nthe gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux\nwill be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of\nwhom we shall deprive you.’",
      "“It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more this\nwinter.”\n\n“It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.”",
      "“Why will you think so? It must be his own doing; he is his own master.\nBut you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which\nparticularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_. ‘Mr. Darcy is\nimpatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely\nless eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has\nher equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection\nshe inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still\nmore interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being\nhereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to\nyou my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country\nwithout confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\nunreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have\nfrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her\nrelations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’s\npartiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most\ncapable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these circumstances to\nfavour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest\nJane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness\nof so many?’ What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said\nJane, as she finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly\ndeclare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister;\nthat she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that\nif she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means (most\nkindly!) to put me on my guard. Can there be any other opinion on the\nsubject?”",
      "“Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?”\n\n“Most willingly.”\n\n“You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is\nin love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to\ntown in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he\ndoes not care about you.”\n\nJane shook her head.\n\n“Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you\ntogether can doubt his affection; Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot: she\nis not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.\nDarcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the\ncase is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she\nis the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion\nthat when there has been _one_ inter-marriage, she may have less trouble\nin achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I\ndare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my\ndearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because Miss Bingley\ntells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\ndegree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on\nTuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead\nof being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”",
      "“If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your\nrepresentation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the\nfoundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving\nanyone; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived\nherself.”\n\n“That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you\nwill not take comfort in mine: believe her to be deceived, by all means.\nYou have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”\n\n“But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\naccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry\nelsewhere?”\n\n“You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature\ndeliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is\nmore than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you,\nby all means, to refuse him.”\n\n“How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling; “you must know, that,\nthough I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could\nnot hesitate.”\n\n“I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider\nyour situation with much compassion.”\n\n“But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\nrequired. A thousand things may arise in six months.”",
      "The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost\ncontempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline’s\ninterested wishes; and she could not for a moment suppose that those\nwishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man\nso totally independent of everyone.\n\nShe represented to her sister, as forcibly as possible, what she felt on\nthe subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.\nJane’s temper was not desponding; and she was gradually led to hope,\nthough the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that\nBingley would return to Netherfield, and answer every wish of her heart.\n\nThey agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the\nfamily, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct;\nbut even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,\nand she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen\nto go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After\nlamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation of\nthinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again, and soon dining at\nLongbourn; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration,\nthat, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take\ncare to have two full courses.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases; and again, during the\nchief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.\nElizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps him in good\nhumour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.”",
      "Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and\nthat it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was\nvery amiable; but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth\nhad any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure her\nfrom any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards\nherself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so\nfavourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost\nsure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.\nBut here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his\ncharacter; for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next\nmorning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw\nhimself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\nfrom a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to\nconjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known\ntill its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost\nsecure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,\nhe was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His\nreception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas\nperceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and\ninstantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had\nshe dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.",
      "In as short a time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow,\neverything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as\nthey entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that\nwas to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must\nbe waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with\nhis happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must\nguard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its\ncontinuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and\ndisinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that\nestablishment were gained.\n\nSir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;\nand it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins’s present\ncircumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom\nthey could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were\nexceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more\ninterest than the matter had ever\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“So much love and eloquence”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]",
      "excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and\nSir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins\nshould be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly\nexpedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St.\nJames’s. The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the\noccasion. The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two\nsooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved\nfrom their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid. Charlotte\nherself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time\nto consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr.\nCollins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was\nirksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would\nbe her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony,\nmarriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable\nprovision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however\nuncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative\nfrom want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of\ntwenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good\nluck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the\nsurprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she\nvalued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and\nprobably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be\nshaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved\nto give her the information herself; and therefore charged Mr. Collins,\nwhen he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had\npassed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very\ndutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the\ncuriosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct\nquestions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was\nat the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to\npublish his prosperous love.",
      "As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of\nthe family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies\nmoved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and\ncordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again,\nwhenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.\n\n“My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly\ngratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you\nmay be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as\npossible.”\n\nThey were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for\nso speedy a return, immediately said,--\n\n“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here, my\ngood sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of\noffending your patroness.”\n\n“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you\nfor this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so\nmaterial a step without her Ladyship’s concurrence.”\n\n“You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk anything rather than her\ndispleasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us\nagain, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,\nand be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.”",
      "“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\naffectionate attention; and, depend upon it, you will speedily receive\nfrom me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of\nyour regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins,\nthough my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall\nnow take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting\nmy cousin Elizabeth.”\n\nWith proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally\nsurprised to find that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished\nto understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of\nher younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.\nShe rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was a\nsolidity in his reflections which often struck her; and though by no\nmeans so clever as herself, she thought that, if encouraged to read and\nimprove himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\nagreeable companion. But on the following morning every hope of this\nkind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a\nprivate conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.",
      "The possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with her\nfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two: but\nthat Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility\nas that she could encourage him herself; and her astonishment was\nconsequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and\nshe could not help crying out,--\n\n“Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte, impossible!”\n\nThe steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her\nstory gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a\nreproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained\nher composure, and calmly replied,--\n\n“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible\nthat Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,\nbecause he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”\n\nBut Elizabeth had now recollected herself; and, making a strong effort\nfor it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that the\nprospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she\nwished her all imaginable happiness.",
      "“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte; “you must be surprised,\nvery much surprised, so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.\nBut when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be\nsatisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know. I never\nwas. I ask only a comfortable home; and, considering Mr. Collins’s\ncharacter, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my\nchance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on\nentering the marriage state.”",
      "Elizabeth quietly answered “undoubtedly;” and, after an awkward pause,\nthey returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much\nlonger; and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It\nwas a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so\nunsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making two offers\nof marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now\naccepted. She had always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was\nnot exactly like her own; but she could not have supposed it possible\nthat, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better\nfeeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte, the wife of Mr. Collins, was a\nmost humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing\nherself, and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction\nthat it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot\nshe had chosen.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“Protested he must be entirely mistaken.”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what\nshe had heard, and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it,\nwhen Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to\nannounce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,\nand much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the\nhouses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,\nbut incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than\npoliteness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always\nunguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,--\n\n“Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know\nthat Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”\n\nNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\nwithout anger such treatment: but Sir William’s good-breeding carried\nhim through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the\ntruth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the\nmost forbearing courtesy.",
      "Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant\na situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by\nmentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and\nendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,\nby the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she\nwas readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the\nhappiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character\nof Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.",
      "Mrs. Bennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say a great deal while\nSir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings\nfound a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving\nthe whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins\nhad been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy\ntogether; and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two\ninferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that\nElizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that\nshe herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two\npoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could\nconsole and nothing appease her. Nor did that day wear out her\nresentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without\nscolding her: a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William\nor Lady Lucas without being rude; and many months were gone before she\ncould at all forgive their daughter.\n\nMr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such\nas he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for\nit gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had\nbeen used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and\nmore foolish than his daughter!",
      "Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match: but she said\nless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;\nnor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and\nLydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a\nclergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news\nto spread at Meryton.\n\nLady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on\nMrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she\ncalled at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,\nthough Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been\nenough to drive happiness away.\n\nBetween Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them\nmutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no\nreal confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her\ndisappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her\nsister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could\nnever be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as\nBingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.",
      "Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting\nthe days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised\nletter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their\nfather, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a\ntwelve-month’s abode in the family might have prompted. After\ndischarging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them,\nwith many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the\naffection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained\nthat it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had\nbeen so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at\nLongbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight;\nfor Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that\nshe wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would\nbe an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early\nday for making him the happiest of men.",
      "Mr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\npleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to\ncomplain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come\nto Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient\nand exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house\nwhile her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the\nmost disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they\ngave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued\nabsence.\n\nNeither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after\nday passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the\nreport which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to\nNetherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.\nBennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous\nfalsehood.",
      "Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that\nhis sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she\nwas to admit an idea so destructive to Jane’s happiness, and so\ndishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its\nfrequently recurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters,\nand of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss\nDarcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for\nthe strength of his attachment.\n\nAs for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more\npainful than Elizabeth’s: but whatever she felt she was desirous of\nconcealing; and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject\nwas never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an\nhour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her\nimpatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he\ndid not come back she should think herself very ill-used. It needed all\nJane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable\ntranquillity.",
      "Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his\nreception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his\nfirst introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;\nand, luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them\nfrom a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by\nhim at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time\nto make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“_Whenever she spoke in a low voice_”\n]\n\nMrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of\nanything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and\nwherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of\nMiss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she\nregarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see\nthem, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and\nwhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that\nthey were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself\nand her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet was dead. She\ncomplained bitterly of all this to her husband.",
      "“Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that Charlotte\nLucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_ should be forced\nto make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!”\n\n“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for\nbetter things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor.”\n\nThis was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet; and, therefore, instead of\nmaking any answer, she went on as before.\n\n“I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was\nnot for the entail, I should not mind it.”\n\n“What should not you mind?”\n\n“I should not mind anything at all.”\n\n“Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\ninsensibility.”\n\n“I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How\nanyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one’s own\ndaughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins, too!\nWhy should _he_ have it more than anybody else?”\n\n“I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMiss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first\nsentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for\nthe winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret at not having had\ntime to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left\nthe country.",
      "Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of\nthe letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the\nwriter, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy’s praise occupied\nthe chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on; and Caroline\nboasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict\nthe accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former\nletter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an\ninmate of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of\nthe latter with regard to new furniture.",
      "Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,\nheard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern\nfor her sister and resentment against all others. To Caroline’s\nassertion of her brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy, she paid no\ncredit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she\nhad ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she\ncould not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness\nof temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave\nof his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to\nthe caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been\nthe only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in\nwhatever manner he thought best; but her sister’s was involved in it, as\nshe thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on\nwhich reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She\ncould think of nothing else; and yet, whether Bingley’s regard had\nreally died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference;\nwhether he had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had\nescaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of\nhim must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’s\nsituation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.",
      "A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to\nElizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them together, after a\nlonger irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could\nnot help saying,--\n\n“O that my dear mother had more command over herself! she can have no\nidea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I\nwill not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall\nall be as we were before.”\n\nElizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said\nnothing.\n\n“You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have no\nreason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my\nacquaintance but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and\nnothing to reproach him with. Thank God I have not _that_ pain. A little\ntime, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better----”\n\nWith a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately,\nthat it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it\nhas done no harm to anyone but myself.”\n\n“My dear Jane,” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good. Your sweetness\nand disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to\nyou. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you\ndeserve.”",
      "Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back\nthe praise on her sister’s warm affection.\n\n“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the\nworld respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. _I_ only want\nto think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be\nafraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your\nprivilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people\nwhom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see\nof the world the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms\nmy belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the\nlittle dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit\nor sense. I have met with two instances lately: one I will not mention,\nthe other is Charlotte’s marriage. It is unaccountable! in every view it\nis unaccountable!”\n\n“My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will\nruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of\nsituation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins’s respectability, and\nCharlotte’s prudent, steady character. Remember that she is one of a\nlarge family; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match; and be\nready to believe, for everybody’s sake, that she may feel something like\nregard and esteem for our cousin.”",
      "“To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else\ncould be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that\nCharlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her\nunderstanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a\nconceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man: you know he is, as well as\nI do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him\ncannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though\nit is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,\nchange the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade\nyourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of\ndanger security for happiness.”\n\n“I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied\nJane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy\ntogether. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You\nmentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat\nyou, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and\nsaying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy\nourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man\nto be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but\nour own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than\nit does.”",
      "“And men take care that they should.”\n\n“If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea\nof there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”\n\n“I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to design,”\nsaid Elizabeth; “but, without scheming to do wrong, or to make others\nunhappy, there may be error and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,\nwant of attention to other people’s feelings, and want of resolution,\nwill do the business.”\n\n“And do you impute it to either of those?”\n\n“Yes; to the last. But if I go on I shall displease you by saying what I\nthink of persons you esteem. Stop me, whilst you can.”\n\n“You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”\n\n“Yes, in conjunction with his friend.”\n\n“I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can\nonly wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me no other woman can\nsecure it.”\n\n“Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his\nhappiness: they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they\nmay wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great\nconnections, and pride.”",
      "“Beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied Jane;\n“but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have\nknown her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love\nher better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely\nthey should have opposed their brother’s. What sister would think\nherself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very\nobjectionable? If they believed him attached to me they would not try to\npart us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an\naffection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most\nunhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been\nmistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of\nwhat I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it\nin the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”\n\nElizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley’s\nname was scarcely ever mentioned between them.",
      "Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no\nmore; and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account\nfor it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it\nwith less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what\nshe did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely\nthe effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw\nher no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at\nthe time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet’s best\ncomfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.\n\nMr. Bennet treated the matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he, one\nday, “your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next\nto being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and\nthen. It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction\namong her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to\nbe long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough at\nMeryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham\nbe your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”\n\n“Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not\nall expect Jane’s good fortune.”",
      "“True,” said Mr. Bennet; “but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of\nthat kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will\nalways make the most of it.”\n\nMr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom\nwhich the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn\nfamily. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now\nadded that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already\nheard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,\nwas now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was\npleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they\nhad known anything of the matter.\n\nMiss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any\nextenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of\nHertfordshire: her mild and steady candour always pleaded for\nallowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes; but by everybody else\nMr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.\nCollins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of\nSaturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his\nside by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to\nhope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day\nwould be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave\nof his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished\nhis fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father\nanother letter of thanks.\n\nOn the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her\nbrother and his wife, who came, as usual, to spend the Christmas at\nLongbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly\nsuperior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield\nladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by\ntrade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so\nwell-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger\nthan Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant\nwoman, and a great favourite with her Longbourn nieces. Between the two\neldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard.\nThey had frequently been staying with her in town.",
      "The first part of Mrs. Gardiner’s business, on her arrival, was to\ndistribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was\ndone, she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.\nMrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They\nhad all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her\ngirls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing\nin it.\n\n“I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane would have got Mr.\nBingley if she could. But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think\nthat she might have been Mr. Collins’s wife by this time, had not it\nbeen for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,\nand she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have\na daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as\nmuch entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people, indeed,\nsister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of\nthem, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted\nso in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves\nbefore anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the\ngreatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us of\nlong sleeves.”",
      "Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in\nthe course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with her, made her\nsister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the\nconversation.\n\nWhen alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.\n“It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,” said she. “I\nam sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man,\nsuch as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty\ngirl for a few weeks, and, when accident separates them, so easily\nforgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.”\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“Offended two or three young ladies”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n“An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth; “but it will not\ndo for _us_. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen\nthat the interference of friends will persuade a young man of\nindependent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in\nlove with only a few days before.”\n\n“But that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so\ndoubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as\noften applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour’s\nacquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_\nMr. Bingley’s love?”",
      "“I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite\ninattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time\nthey met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he\noffended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance; and I\nspoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer. Could there be\nfiner symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?”\n\n“Oh, yes! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor\nJane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get\nover it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you\nwould have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would\nbe prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be of\nservice--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as\nanything.”\n\nElizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded\nof her sister’s ready acquiescence.\n\n“I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard to\nthis young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of\ntown, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go\nout so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,\nunless he really comes to see her.”",
      "“And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his\nfriend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a\npart of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may,\nperhaps, have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he\nwould hardly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its\nimpurities, were he once to enter it; and, depend upon it, Mr. Bingley\nnever stirs without him.”\n\n“So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane\ncorrespond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.”\n\n“She will drop the acquaintance entirely.”\n\nBut, in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this\npoint, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley’s being\nwithheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which\nconvinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely\nhopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that\nhis affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends\nsuccessfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane’s\nattractions.",
      "Miss Bennet accepted her aunt’s invitation with pleasure; and the\nBingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she\nhoped, by Caroline’s not living in the same house with her brother, she\nmight occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of\nseeing him.\n\nThe Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,\nthe Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its\nengagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment\nof her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family\ndinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always\nmade part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and\non these occasions Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth’s\nwarm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing\nthem, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference\nof each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she\nresolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left\nHertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such\nan attachment.",
      "To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,\nunconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,\nbefore her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part\nof Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many\nacquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since\nthe death of Darcy’s father, five years before, it was yet in his power\nto give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been\nin the way of procuring.\n\nMrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by\ncharacter perfectly well. Here, consequently, was an inexhaustible\nsubject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with\nthe minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her\ntribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was\ndelighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the\npresent Mr. Darcy’s treatment of him, she tried to remember something of\nthat gentleman’s reputed disposition, when quite a lad, which might\nagree with it; and was confident, at last, that she recollected having\nheard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud,\nill-natured boy.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“Will you come and see me?”\n]\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "Mrs. Gardiner’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on\nthe first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone: after\nhonestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:--\n\n“You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you\nare warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking\nopenly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve\nyourself, or endeavour to involve him, in an affection which the want of\nfortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against\n_him_: he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he\nought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is--you\nmust not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all\nexpect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and\ngood conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.”\n\n“My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”\n\n“Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”\n\n“Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of\nmyself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I\ncan prevent it.”\n\n“Elizabeth, you are not serious now.”",
      "“I beg your pardon. I will try again. At present I am not in love with\nMr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,\nthe most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to\nme--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence\nof it. Oh, _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father’s opinion of me does\nme the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My\nfather, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I\nshould be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but\nsince we see, every day, that where there is affection young people are\nseldom withheld, by immediate want of fortune, from entering into\nengagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many\nof my fellow-creatures, if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that\nit would be wiser to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is\nnot to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his\nfirst object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In\nshort, I will do my best.”\n\n“Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very\noften. At least you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.”",
      "“As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; “very\ntrue, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine\nthat he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been\nso frequently invited this week. You know my mother’s ideas as to the\nnecessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my\nhonour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now I hope you\nare satisfied.”\n\nHer aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth, having thanked her for\nthe kindness of her hints, they parted,--a wonderful instance of advice\nbeing given on such a point without being resented.\n\nMr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted\nby the Gardiners and Jane; but, as he took up his abode with the\nLucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His\nmarriage was now fast approaching; and she was at length so far resigned\nas to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured\ntone, that she “_wished_ they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the\nwedding-day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and\nwhen she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother’s\nungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,\naccompanied her out of the room. As they went down stairs together,\nCharlotte said,--",
      "“I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.”\n\n“_That_ you certainly shall.”\n\n“And I have another favour to ask. Will you come and see me?”\n\n“We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.”\n\n“I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to\ncome to Hunsford.”\n\nElizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the\nvisit.\n\n“My father and Maria are to come to me in March,” added Charlotte, “and\nI hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be\nas welcome to me as either of them.”",
      "The wedding took place: the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from\nthe church door, and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the\nsubject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend, and their\ncorrespondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been: that it\nshould be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never\naddress her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over;\nand, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the\nsake of what had been rather than what was. Charlotte’s first letters\nwere received with a good deal of eagerness: there could not but be\ncuriosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would\nlike Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to\nbe; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte\nexpressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She\nwrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing\nwhich she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and\nroads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine’s behaviour was most\nfriendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins’s picture of Hunsford and\nRosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait\nfor her own visit there, to know the rest.",
      "Jane had already written a few lines to her sister, to announce their\nsafe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it\nwould be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.\n\nHer impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience\ngenerally is. Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or\nhearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that\nher last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been\nlost.\n\n“My aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the\ntown, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.”\n\nShe wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.\n“I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very\nglad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming\nto London. I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.\nI inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much\nengaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that\nMiss Darcy was expected to dinner: I wish I could see her. My visit was\nnot long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall\nsoon see them here.”\n\nElizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that\naccident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister’s being in town.",
      "Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to\npersuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be\nblind to Miss Bingley’s inattention. After waiting at home every morning\nfor a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the\nvisitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and, yet\nmore, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself\nno longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister\nwill prove what she felt:--",
      "“My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in\n     her better judgment, at my expense, when I confess myself to have\n     been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me. But, my\n     dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me\n     obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour\n     was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at\n     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but,\n     if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should\n     be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;\n     and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she\n     did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she\n     made a slight, formal apology for not calling before, said not a\n     word of wishing to see me again, and was, in every respect, so\n     altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly\n     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I\n     cannot help blaming, her. She was very wrong in singling me out as\n     she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on\n     her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been\n     acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her\n     brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and\n     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she\n     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so\n     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may\n     feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder,\n     however, at her having any such fears now, because if he had at all\n     cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my\n     being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and\n     yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to\n     persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot\n     understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be\n     almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of\n     duplicity in all this. I will endeavour to banish every painful\n     thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,\n     and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear\n     from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never\n     returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not\n     with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely\n     glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at\n     Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am\n     sure you will be very comfortable there.",
      "“Yours, etc.”\n\nThis letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned, as she\nconsidered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.\nAll expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not\neven wish for any renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every\nreview of it; and, as a punishment for him, as well as a possible\nadvantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.\nDarcy’s sister, as, by Wickham’s account, she would make him abundantly\nregret what he had thrown away.",
      "Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise\nconcerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had\nsuch to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to\nherself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,\nhe was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to\nsee it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.\nHer heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied\nwith believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune\npermitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most\nremarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself\nagreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than\nin Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.\nNothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and, while able to\nsuppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was\nready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very\nsincerely wish him happy.",
      "All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and, after relating the\ncircumstances, she thus went on:--“I am now convinced, my dear aunt,\nthat I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that\npure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,\nand wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial\ntowards _him_, they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find\nout that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think\nher a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My\nwatchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more\ninteresting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love\nwith him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.\nImportance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take\nhis defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways\nof the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that\nhandsome young men must have something to live on as well as the\nplain.”\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“On the Stairs”\n]\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise\ndiversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and\nsometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take\nElizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of\ngoing thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the\nplan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater\npleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire\nof seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.\nThere was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such a mother and such\nuncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change\nwas not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would, moreover, give\nher a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have\nbeen very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,\nand was finally settled according to Charlotte’s first sketch. She was\nto accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of\nspending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became as\nperfect as plan could be.\n\nThe only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,\nand who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he\ntold her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.",
      "The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on\nhis side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that\nElizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the\nfirst to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner\nof bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what\nshe was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their\nopinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there\nwas a solicitude, an interest, which she felt must ever attach her to\nhim with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that,\nwhether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable\nand pleasing.\n\nHer fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think\nhim less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a\ngood-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say\nthat could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much\ndelight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but\nshe had known Sir William’s too long. He could tell her nothing new of\nthe wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were\nworn out, like his information.",
      "It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early\nas to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner’s\ndoor, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival: when\nthey entered the passage, she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,\nlooking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and\nlovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,\nwhose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow them to\nwait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her\nfor a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and\nkindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and\nshopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\n\nElizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first subject was her\nsister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to\nher minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her\nspirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to\nhope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the\nparticulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and\nrepeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and\nherself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the\nacquaintance.",
      "Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham’s desertion, and\ncomplimented her on bearing it so well.\n\n“But, my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss King? I\nshould be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”\n\n“Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,\nbetween the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,\nand avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,\nbecause it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a\ngirl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is\nmercenary.”\n\n“If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know\nwhat to think.”\n\n“She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.”\n\n“But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather’s death\nmade her mistress of this fortune?”\n\n“No--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_\naffections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for\nmaking love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally\npoor?”\n\n“But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so\nsoon after this event.”\n\n“A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant\ndecorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,\nwhy should _we_?”",
      "“_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her being\ndeficient in something herself--sense or feeling.”\n\n“Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose. _He_ shall be\nmercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.”\n\n“No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,\nto think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.”\n\n“Oh, if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in\nDerbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not\nmuch better. I am sick of them all. Thank heaven! I am going to-morrow\nwhere I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has\nneither manners nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones\nworth knowing, after all.”\n\n“Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”\n\nBefore they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the\nunexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in\na tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.\n\n“We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us,” said Mrs.\nGardiner; “but perhaps, to the Lakes.”",
      "No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her\nacceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “My dear, dear\naunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! You give me\nfresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are men\nto rocks and mountains? Oh, what hours of transport we shall spend! And\nwhen we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without\nbeing able to give one accurate idea of anything. We _will_ know where\nwe have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains,\nand rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when\nwe attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling\nabout its relative situation. Let _our_ first effusions be less\ninsupportable than those of the generality of travellers.”\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“At the door”\n]\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nEvery object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to\nElizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had\nseen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,\nand the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.",
      "When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in\nsearch of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.\nThe paling of Rosings park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth\nsmiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.",
      "At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the\nroad, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge,\neverything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte\nappeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which\nled by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of\nthe whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing\nat the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the\nliveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with\ncoming, when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw\ninstantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage:\nhis formal civility was just what it had been; and he detained her some\nminutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her\nfamily. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the\nneatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were\nin the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious\nformality, to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s\noffers of refreshment.",
      "Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help\nfancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect,\nand its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if\nwishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though\neverything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him\nby any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend,\nthat she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr.\nCollins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,\nwhich certainly was not seldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on\nCharlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general\nCharlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire\nevery article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the\nfender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had\nhappened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the\ngarden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of\nwhich he attended himself. To work in his garden was one of his most\nrespectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance\nwith which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and\nowned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way\nthrough every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an\ninterval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out\nwith a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the\nfields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in\nthe most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which\nthe country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with\nthe prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that\nbordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a\nhandsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.",
      "From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;\nbut the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white\nfrost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte\ntook her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,\nprobably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s\nhelp. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything\nwas fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency, of which\nElizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be\nforgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by\nCharlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often\nforgotten.\n\nShe had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It\nwas spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining\nin, observed,--",
      "“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine\nde Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will\nbe delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I\ndoubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when\nservice is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will\ninclude you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she\nhonours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is\ncharming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to\nwalk home. Her Ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I\n_should_ say, one of her Ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.”\n\n“Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman, indeed,” added\nCharlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”\n\n“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of\nwoman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”",
      "The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and\ntelling again what had been already written; and when it closed,\nElizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon\nCharlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,\nand composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it\nwas all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would\npass, the quiet tenour of their usual employments, the vexatious\ninterruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse\nwith Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.\n\nAbout the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready\nfor a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in\nconfusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running\nupstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened\nthe door, and met Maria in the landing-place, who, breathless with\nagitation, cried out,--\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“In Conversation with the ladies”\n\n[Copyright 1894 by George Allen.]]\n\n“Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for\nthere is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make\nhaste, and come down this moment.”",
      "Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more;\nand down they ran into the dining-room which fronted the lane, in quest\nof this wonder; it was two ladies, stopping in a low phaeton at the\ngarden gate.\n\n“And is this all?” cried Elizabeth. “I expected at least that the pigs\nwere got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her\ndaughter!”\n\n“La! my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not Lady\nCatherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them. The\nother is Miss De Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little\ncreature. Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!”\n\n“She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.\nWhy does she not come in?”\n\n“Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours\nwhen Miss De Bourgh comes in.”\n\n“I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. “She\nlooks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will\nmake him a very proper wife.”\n\nMr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation\nwith the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth’s high diversion, was\nstationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness\nbefore him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that\nway.",
      "At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and\nthe others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two\ngirls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which\nCharlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked\nto dine at Rosings the next day.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n‘Lady Catherine, said she, you have given me a treasure.’\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMr. Collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.\nThe power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering\nvisitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his\nwife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of\ndoing it should be given so soon was such an instance of Lady\nCatherine’s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.\n\n“I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by\nher Ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening\nat Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that\nit would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?\nWho could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine\nthere (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so\nimmediately after your arrival?”",
      "“I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William,\n“from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which\nmy situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such\ninstances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”\n\nScarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their\nvisit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what\nthey were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and\nso splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.\n\nWhen the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to\nElizabeth,--\n\n“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady\nCatherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which\nbecomes herself and daughter. I would advise you merely to put on\nwhatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion\nfor anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for\nbeing simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank\npreserved.”",
      "While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different\ndoors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much\nobjected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of\nher Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,\nwho had been little used to company; and she looked forward to her\nintroduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done\nto his presentation at St. James’s.\n\nAs the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile\nacross the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and\nElizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such\nraptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but\nslightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the\nhouse, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally\ncost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.\n\nWhen they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every moment\nincreasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.\nElizabeth’s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady\nCatherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or\nmiraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she\nthought she could witness without trepidation.",
      "From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\nrapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed\nthe servants through an antechamber to the room where Lady Catherine,\nher daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her Ladyship, with great\ncondescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it\nwith her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was\nperformed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks\nwhich he would have thought necessary.",
      "In spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so completely\nawed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage\nenough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;\nand his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge\nof her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself\nquite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her\ncomposedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked\nfeatures, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not\nconciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her\nvisitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by\nsilence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as\nmarked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to\nElizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she\nbelieved Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.",
      "When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment\nshe soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the\ndaughter, she could almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment at her\nbeing so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any\nlikeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly: her\nfeatures, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very\nlittle, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance\nthere was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening\nto what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\nher eyes.\n\nAfter sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to\nadmire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,\nand Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth\nlooking at in the summer.",
      "The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,\nand all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he\nhad likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by\nher Ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish\nnothing greater. He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity;\nand every dish was commended first by him, and then by Sir William, who\nwas now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a\nmanner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady\nCatherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most\ngracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty\nto them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready\nto speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between\nCharlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in\nlistening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all\nthe dinnertime. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how\nlittle Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and\nfearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question,\nand the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.",
      "When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be\ndone but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any\nintermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every\nsubject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have\nher judgment controverted. She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic\nconcerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as\nto the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be\nregulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the\ncare of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was\nbeneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with an\noccasion for dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with\nMrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and\nElizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew\nthe least, and who, she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel,\npretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times how many sisters\nshe had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of\nthem were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they\nhad been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her\nmother’s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her\nquestions, but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then\nobserved,--",
      "“Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think? For your\nsake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no\noccasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought\nnecessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you play and sing, Miss\nBennet?”\n\n“A little.”\n\n“Oh then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our\ninstrument is a capital one, probably superior to ---- you shall try it\nsome day. Do your sisters play and sing?”\n\n“One of them does.”\n\n“Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss\nWebbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do\nyou draw?”\n\n“No, not at all.”\n\n“What, none of you?”\n\n“Not one.”\n\n“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother\nshould have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”\n\n“My mother would have no objection, but my father hates London.”\n\n“Has your governess left you?”\n\n“We never had any governess.”\n\n“No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home\nwithout a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must\nhave been quite a slave to your education.”\n\nElizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not\nbeen the case.\n\n“Then who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must\nhave been neglected.”",
      "“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as\nwished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to\nread, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be\nidle certainly might.”\n\n“Ay, no doubt: but that is what a governess will prevent; and if I had\nknown your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage\none. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady\nand regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is\nwonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that\nway. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces\nof Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and\nit was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who\nwas merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite\ndelighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe’s\ncalling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. ‘Lady\nCatherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a treasure.’ Are any of your\nyounger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”\n\n“Yes, ma’am, all.”\n\n“All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The\nyounger ones out before the elder are married! Your younger sisters must\nbe very young?”",
      "“Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much\nin company. But really, ma’am, I think it would be very hard upon\nyounger sisters that they should not have their share of society and\namusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to\nmarry early. The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth\nas the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would\nnot be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”\n\n“Upon my word,” said her Ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly\nfor so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”\n\n“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your\nLadyship can hardly expect me to own it.”\n\nLady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;\nand Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever\ndared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.\n\n“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not\nconceal your age.”\n\n“I am not one-and-twenty.”",
      "When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables\nwere placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat\ndown to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the\ntwo girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her\nparty. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was\nuttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson\nexpressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or\nhaving too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the\nother table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes\nof the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins\nwas employed in agreeing to everything her Ladyship said, thanking her\nfor every fish he won, and apologizing if he thought he won too many.\nSir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes\nand noble names.",
      "When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,\nthe tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,\ngratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered\nround the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were\nto have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the\narrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.\nCollins’s side, and as many bows on Sir William’s, they departed. As\nsoon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her\ncousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,\nfor Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But\nher commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means\nsatisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship’s\npraise into his own hands.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long\nenough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled,\nand of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not\noften met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his\nmornings to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country: but\nwhen he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,\nand Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her\ncousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfast\nand dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in\nreading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room,\nwhich fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.\nElizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer\nthe dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a\npleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent\nreason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been\nmuch less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and\nshe gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.",
      "From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and\nwere indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went\nalong, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,\nwhich he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened\nalmost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had\na few minutes’ conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever\nprevailed on to get out.\n\nVery few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and\nnot many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;\nand till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings\nto be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many\nhours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,\nand nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during\nthese visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,\nand advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement\nof the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she\naccepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding\nout that Mrs. Collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family.",
      "Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in the\ncommission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate\nin her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by\nMr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be\nquarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the\nvillage to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold\nthem into harmony and plenty.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“he never failed to inform them”\n]",
      "The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;\nand, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one\ncard-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart\nof the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living\nof the neighbourhood in general was beyond the Collinses’ reach. This,\nhowever, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time\ncomfortably enough: there were half hours of pleasant conversation with\nCharlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she\nhad often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where\nshe frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was\nalong the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was\na nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and\nwhere she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s curiosity.",
      "In this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.\nEaster was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an\naddition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be\nimportant. Elizabeth had heard, soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy\nwas expected there in the course of a few weeks; and though there were\nnot many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would\nfurnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and\nshe might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on him\nwere, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined\nby Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest\nsatisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and\nseemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by\nMiss Lucas and herself.\n\nHis arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking\nthe whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,\nin order to have\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“The gentlemen accompanied him.”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]",
      "the earliest assurance of it; and, after making his bow as the carriage\nturned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the\nfollowing morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were\ntwo nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought\nwith him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord ----;\nand, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned,\nthe gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen them from her\nhusband’s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the\nother, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,--\n\n“I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would\nnever have come so soon to wait upon me.”\n\nElizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment\nbefore their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly\nafterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,\nwho led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and\naddress most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been\nused to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual\nreserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her\nfriend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely\ncourtesied to him, without saying a word.",
      "Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly, with the\nreadiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but\nhis cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and\ngarden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.\nAt length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of\nElizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual\nway; and, after a moment’s pause, added,--\n\n“My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never\nhappened to see her there?”\n\nShe was perfectly sensible that he never had: but she wished to see\nwhether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the\nBingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he\nanswered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The\nsubject was pursued no further, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went\naway.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“At Church”\n]\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,\nand the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of\ntheir engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they\nreceived any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the\nhouse they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,\nalmost a week after the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured by\nsuch an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\ncome there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little\nof either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called\nat the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had\nonly seen at church.\n\nThe invitation was accepted, of course, and at a proper hour they joined\nthe party in Lady Catherine’s drawing-room. Her Ladyship received them\ncivilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so\nacceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,\nalmost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,\nmuch more than to any other person in the room.",
      "Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them: anything was a\nwelcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins’s pretty friend had,\nmoreover, caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and\ntalked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying\nat home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so\nwell entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much\nspirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as\nwell as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned\ntowards them with a look of curiosity; and that her Ladyship, after a\nwhile, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not\nscruple to call out,--\n\n“What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking\nof? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.”\n\n“We were talking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able to avoid\na reply.",
      "“Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I\nmust have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.\nThere are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true\nenjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever\nlearnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her\nhealth had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have\nperformed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”\n\nMr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proficiency.\n\n“I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said Lady\nCatherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,\nif she does not practise a great deal.”\n\n“I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such advice.\nShe practises very constantly.”",
      "“So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write\nto her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often\ntell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired without\nconstant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will\nnever play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs.\nCollins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told\nher, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.\nJenkinson’s room. She would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that part\nof the house.”\n\nMr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and made\nno answer.\n\nWhen coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having\npromised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He\ndrew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then\ntalked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from\nher, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte,\nstationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer’s\ncountenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first\nconvenient pause turned to him with an arch smile, and said,--",
      "“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear\nme. But I will not be alarmed, though your sister _does_ play so well.\nThere is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at\nthe will of others. My courage always rises with every attempt to\nintimidate me.”\n\n“I shall not say that you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could\nnot really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I\nhave had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you\nfind great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which, in fact,\nare not your own.”\n\nElizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to\nColonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of\nme, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky\nin meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a\npart of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree\nof credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention\nall that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me\nleave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,\nand such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”\n\n“I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.",
      "“Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried Colonel\nFitzwilliam. “I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”\n\n“You shall hear, then--but prepare for something very dreadful. The\nfirst time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at\na ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four\ndances! I am sorry to pain you, but so it was. He danced only four\ndances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more\nthan one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy,\nyou cannot deny the fact.”\n\n“I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly\nbeyond my own party.”\n\n“True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel\nFitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.”\n\n“Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better had I sought an\nintroduction, but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”\n\n“Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still\naddressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. “Shall we ask him why a man of sense and\neducation, and who has lived in the world, is ill-qualified to recommend\nhimself to strangers?”\n\n“I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying to\nhim. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”",
      "“I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said Darcy,\n“of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot\ncatch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their\nconcerns, as I often see done.”\n\n“My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the\nmasterly manner which I see so many women’s do. They have not the same\nforce or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I\nhave always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take\nthe trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers\nas capable as any other woman’s of superior execution.”\n\nDarcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. You have employed your\ntime much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can\nthink anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.”\n\nHere they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know\nwhat they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.\nLady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said\nto Darcy,--\n\n“Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and\ncould have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion\nof fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne’s. Anne would have\nbeen a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”",
      "Elizabeth looked at Darcy, to see how cordially he assented to his\ncousin’s praise: but neither at that moment nor at any other could she\ndiscern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss\nDe Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have\nbeen just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.\n\nLady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth’s performance, mixing\nwith them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received\nthem with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the\ngentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship’s carriage was\nready to take them all home.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nElizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,\nwhile Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,\nwhen she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a\nvisitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be\nLady Catherine; and under that apprehension was putting away her\nhalf-finished letter, that she might escape all impertinent questions,\nwhen the door opened, and to her very great surprise Mr. Darcy, and Mr.\nDarcy only, entered the room.\n\nHe seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologized for his\nintrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to\nbe within.",
      "They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,\nseemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely\nnecessary, therefore, to think of something; and in this emergency\nrecollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling\ncurious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty\ndeparture, she observed,--\n\n“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!\nIt must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you\nall after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day\nbefore. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?”\n\n“Perfectly so, I thank you.”\n\nShe found that she was to receive no other answer; and, after a short\npause, added,--\n\n“I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever\nreturning to Netherfield again?”\n\n“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend\nvery little of his time there in future. He has many friends, and he is\nat a time of life when friends and engagements are continually\nincreasing.”",
      "“If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the\nneighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we\nmight possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did\nnot take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as\nfor his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same\nprinciple.”\n\n“I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up as\nsoon as any eligible purchase offers.”\n\nElizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his\nfriend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the\ntrouble of finding a subject to him.\n\nHe took the hint and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortable\nhouse. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.\nCollins first came to Hunsford.”\n\n“I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her\nkindness on a more grateful object.”\n\n“Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.”",
      "“Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of\nthe very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made\nhim happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though\nI am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest\nthing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however; and, in a\nprudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.”\n\n“It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a\ndistance of her own family and friends.”\n\n“An easy distance do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.”\n\n“And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day’s\njourney. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.”\n\n“I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_\nof the match,” cried Elizabeth. “I should never have said Mrs. Collins\nwas settled _near_ her family.”\n\n“It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond\nthe very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.”\n\nAs he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she\nunderstood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and\nNetherfield, and she blushed as she answered,--",
      "“I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her\nfamily. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many\nvarying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expense of\ntravelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the\ncase _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not\nsuch a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my\nfriend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_\nthe present distance.”\n\nMr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “_You_ cannot\nhave a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have\nbeen always at Longbourn.”\n\nElizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of\nfeeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,\nglancing over it, said, in a colder voice,--\n\n“Are you pleased with Kent?”\n\nA short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side\ncalm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte\nand her sister, just returned from their walk. The _tête-à-tête_\nsurprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his\nintruding on Miss Bennet, and, after sitting a few minutes longer,\nwithout saying much to anybody, went away.\n\n[Illustration: “Accompanied by their aunt”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]",
      "“What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he was\ngone. “My dear Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never\nhave called on us in this familiar way.”",
      "But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,\neven to Charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and, after various\nconjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from\nthe difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable\nfrom the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there\nwas Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be\nalways within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the\npleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the\ntwo cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither\nalmost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes\nseparately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their\naunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he\nhad pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended\nhim still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in\nbeing with him, as well as by his evident admiration, of her former\nfavourite, George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there\nwas less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners, she\nbelieved he might have the best informed mind.",
      "But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage it was more difficult\nto understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there\nten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it\nseemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to\npropriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really\nanimated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel\nFitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was\ngenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told\nher; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of\nlove, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself\nseriously to work to find it out: she watched him whenever they were at\nRosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He\ncertainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that\nlook was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often\ndoubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it\nseemed nothing but absence of mind.",
      "She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his\nbeing partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.\nCollins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of\nraising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her\nopinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would\nvanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.\n\nIn her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying\nColonel Fitzwilliam. He was, beyond comparison, the pleasantest man: he\ncertainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,\nto counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage\nin the church, and his cousin could have none at all.\n\n[Illustration: “On looking up”]\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,\nunexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the\nmischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and, to\nprevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him, at first,\nthat it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,\ntherefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even the third. It seemed like\nwilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance; for on these occasions it was\nnot merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,\nbut he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He\nnever said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking\nor of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third\nencounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her\npleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her\nopinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of\nRosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to\nexpect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying\n_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel\nFitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must\nmean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her\na little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the\npales opposite the Parsonage.",
      "She was engaged one day, as she walked, in re-perusing Jane’s last\nletter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not\nwritten in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy,\nshe saw, on looking up, that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.\nPutting away the letter immediately, and forcing a smile, she said,--\n\n“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”\n\n“I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally\ndo every year, and intended to close it with a call at the Parsonage.\nAre you going much farther?”\n\n“No, I should have turned in a moment.”\n\nAnd accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage\ntogether.\n\n“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.\n\n“Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He\narranges the business just as he pleases.”\n\n“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least\ngreat pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems\nmore to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”\n\n“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.\n“But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than\nmany others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak\nfeelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and\ndependence.”",
      "“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of\neither. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and\ndependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going\nwherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”\n\n“These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have\nexperienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater\nweight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry\nwhere they like.”\n\n“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often\ndo.”\n\n“Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in\nmy rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to\nmoney.”\n\n“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the\nidea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what is\nthe usual price of an earl’s younger son? Unless the elder brother is\nvery sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”\n\nHe answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt\na silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,\nshe soon afterwards said,--",
      "“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of\nhaving somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a\nlasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well\nfor the present; and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he\nlikes with her.”\n\n“No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must\ndivide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.”\n\n“Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of a guardian do you make? Does\nyour charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes\na little difficult to manage; and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she\nmay like to have her own way.”\n\nAs she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner\nin which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to\ngive them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other\ngot pretty near the truth. She directly replied,--\n\n“You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare\nsay she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a\nvery great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and\nMiss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.”\n\n“I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant, gentlemanlike\nman--he is a great friend of Darcy’s.”",
      "“Oh yes,” said Elizabeth drily--“Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.\nBingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”\n\n“Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in\nthose points where he most wants care. From something that he told me\nin our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted\nto him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose\nthat Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.”\n\n“What is it you mean?”\n\n“It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to be\ngenerally known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family it\nwould be an unpleasant thing.”\n\n“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”\n\n“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be\nBingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself\non having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most\nimprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other\nparticulars; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him\nthe kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from\nknowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”\n\n“Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?”\n\n“I understood that there were some very strong objections against the\nlady.”\n\n“And what arts did he use to separate them?”",
      "“He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “He\nonly told me what I have now told you.”\n\nElizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with\nindignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she\nwas so thoughtful.\n\n“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “Your\ncousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the\njudge?”\n\n“You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”\n\n“I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his\nfriend’s inclination; or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to\ndetermine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy. But,”\nshe continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the\nparticulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed\nthat there was much affection in the case.”\n\n“That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam; “but it is\nlessening the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”",
      "This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of\nMr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,\ntherefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent\nmatters till they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,\nas soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption\nof all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other\npeople could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There\ncould not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have\nsuch boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures\ntaken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she\nhad always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and\narrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,\n_he_ was the cause--his pride and caprice were the cause--of all that\nJane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a\nwhile every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart\nin the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have\ninflicted.\n\n“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were Colonel\nFitzwilliam’s words; and these strong objections probably were, her\nhaving one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in\nbusiness in London.",
      "“To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of\nobjection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding\nexcellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could\nanything be urged against my father, who, though with some\npeculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain,\nand respectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thought\nof her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little; but she would\nnot allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.\nDarcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from\nthe want of importance in his friend’s connections than from their want\nof sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly\ngoverned by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of\nretaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.\n\nThe agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a\nheadache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to\nher unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her\ncousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,\nseeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much\nas possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins\ncould not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine’s being rather\ndispleased by her staying at home.",
      "[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWhen they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as\nmuch as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the\nexamination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her\nbeing in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any\nrevival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.\nBut in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that\ncheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,\nproceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly\ndisposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth\nnoticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an\nattention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy’s\nshameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a\nkeener sense of her sister’s sufferings. It was some consolation to\nthink that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,\nand a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be\nwith Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her\nspirits, by all that affection could do.",
      "She could not think of Darcy’s leaving Kent without remembering that his\ncousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear\nthat he had no intentions at all, and, agreeable as he was, she did not\nmean to be unhappy about him.\n\nWhile settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the\ndoor-bell; and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its\nbeing Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in\nthe evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. But\nthis idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently\naffected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the\nroom. In a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her\nhealth, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.\nShe answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and\nthen getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but\nsaid not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her\nin an agitated manner, and thus began:--\n\n“In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be\nrepressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love\nyou.”",
      "Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,\ndoubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement,\nand the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately\nfollowed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the\nheart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of\ntenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority, of its being a\ndegradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed\nto inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the\nconsequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his\nsuit.",
      "In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to\nthe compliment of such a man’s affection, and though her intentions did\nnot vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to\nreceive; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost\nall compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to\nanswer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with\nrepresenting to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of\nall his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer; and with\nexpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of\nhis hand. As he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a\nfavourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his\ncountenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only\nexasperate farther; and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks\nand she said,--",
      "“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\nexpress a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however\nunequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be\nfelt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I\ncannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly\nbestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to\nanyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be\nof short duration. The feelings which you tell me have long prevented\nthe acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in\novercoming it after this explanation.”\n\nMr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed\non her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than\nsurprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of\nhis mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the\nappearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed\nhimself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings\ndreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,--\n\n“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I\nmight, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at\ncivility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”",
      "“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why, with so evident a design\nof offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me\nagainst your will, against your reason, and even against your character?\nWas not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have\nother provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided\nagainst you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been\nfavourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept\nthe man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the\nhappiness of a most beloved sister?”\n\nAs she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion\nwas short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she\ncontinued,--\n\n“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can\nexcuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,\nyou cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means\nof dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the\nworld for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for\ndisappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest\nkind.”\n\nShe paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening\nwith an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.\nHe even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.",
      "“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.\n\nWith assumed tranquillity he then replied, “I have no wish of denying\nthat I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your\nsister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been\nkinder than towards myself.”\n\nElizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,\nbut its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.\n\n“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike\nis founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was\ndecided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received\nmany months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to\nsay? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?\nor under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”\n\n“You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said Darcy,\nin a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\n\n“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an\ninterest in him?”\n\n“His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy, contemptuously,--“yes, his\nmisfortunes have been great indeed.”",
      "“And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth, with energy; “You have\nreduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You\nhave withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed\nfor him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that\nindependence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done\nall this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with\ncontempt and ridicule.”",
      "“And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,\n“is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I\nthank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this\ncalculation, are heavy indeed! But, perhaps,” added he, stopping in his\nwalk, and turning towards her, “these offences might have been\noverlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the\nscruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These\nbitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater\npolicy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my\nbeing impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by\nreflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.\nNor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just.\nCould you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your\nconnections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose\ncondition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”\n\nElizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to\nthe utmost to speak with composure when she said,--\n\n“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your\ndeclaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the\nconcern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a\nmore gentlemanlike manner.”",
      "She saw him start at this; but he said nothing, and she continued,--\n\n“You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way\nthat would have tempted me to accept it.”\n\nAgain his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an\nexpression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on,--\n\n“From the very beginning, from the first moment, I may almost say, of my\nacquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest\nbelief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the\nfeelings of others, were such as to form that groundwork of\ndisapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a\ndislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the\nlast man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”\n\n“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your\nfeelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.\nForgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best\nwishes for your health and happiness.”",
      "And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him\nthe next moment open the front door and quit the house. The tumult of\nher mind was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself,\nand, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour. Her\nastonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by\nevery review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from\nMr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months!\nso much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections\nwhich had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which\nmust appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost\nincredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong\nan affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal\nof what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in\nacknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner\nwhich he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not\nattempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his\nattachment had for a moment excited.\n\nShe continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady\nCatherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter\nCharlotte’s observation, and hurried her away to her room.\n\n[Illustration:",
      "“Hearing herself called”\n]\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nElizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations\nwhich had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the\nsurprise of what had happened: it was impossible to think of anything\nelse; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after\nbreakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding\ndirectly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s\nsometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,\nshe turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road. The\npark paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one\nof the gates into the ground.",
      "After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was\ntempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and\nlook into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had\nmade a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the\nverdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her\nwalk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove\nwhich edged the park: he was moving that way; and fearful of its being\nMr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was\nnow near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,\npronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called,\nthough in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again\ntowards the gate. He had by that time reached it also; and, holding out\na letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty\ncomposure, “I have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope of\nmeeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” and\nthen, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon\nout of sight.",
      "With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\nElizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,\nperceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written\nquite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise\nfull. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated\nfrom Rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:--\n\n“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of\nits containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those\noffers, which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any\nintention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes,\nwhich, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the\neffort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,\nshould have been spared, had not my character required it to be written\nand read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand\nyour attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I\ndemand it of your justice.",
      "“Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal\nmagnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,\nthat, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley\nfrom your sister,--and the other, that I had, in defiance of various\nclaims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate\nprosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and\nwantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged\nfavourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other\ndependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect\nits exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young\npersons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could\nbear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last\nnight so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope\nto be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and\ntheir motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them which is due\nto myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be\noffensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must\nbe obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. I had not been long in\nHertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley\npreferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But\nit was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any\napprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him\nin love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with\nyou, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental\ninformation, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to\na general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain\nevent, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I\nobserved my friend’s behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive\nthat his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed\nin him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open,\ncheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar\nregard; and I remained convinced, from the evening’s scrutiny, that\nthough she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite\nthem by any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken\nhere, _I_ must have been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your\nsister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled\nby such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been\nunreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of\nyour sister’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most\nacute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart\nwas not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing\nher indifferent is certain; but I will venture to say that my\ninvestigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or\nfears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I\nbelieved it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.\nMy objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night\nacknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside\nin my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to\nmy friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes\nwhich, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both\ninstances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not\nimmediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The\nsituation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in\ncomparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost\nuniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and\noccasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend\nyou. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations,\nand your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you\nconsolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid\nany share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on\nyou and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and\ndisposition of both. I will only say, farther, that from what passed\nthat evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every\ninducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve my\nfriend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left\nNetherfield for London on the day following, as you, I am certain,\nremember, with the design of soon returning. The part which I acted is\nnow to be explained. His sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excited\nwith my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike\nsensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we\nshortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordingly\nwent--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my\nfriend the certain evils of such a choice. I described and enforced them\nearnestly. But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed\nhis determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have\nprevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which\nI hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference. He had before\nbelieved her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,\nregard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger\ndependence on my judgment than on his own. To convince him, therefore,\nthat he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. To persuade\nhim against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been\ngiven, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for\nhaving done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct, in the whole\naffair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I\ncondescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him\nyour sister’s being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss\nBingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might\nhave met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard\ndid not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some\ndanger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. It is\ndone, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have\nnothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your\nsister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which\ngoverned me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not\nyet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more weighty\naccusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by\nlaying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he\nhas _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I\nshall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.\nMr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years\nthe management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in\nthe discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service\nto him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was\ntherefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and\nafterwards at Cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father,\nalways poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to\ngive him a gentleman’s education. My father was not only fond of this\nyoung man’s society, whose manners were always engaging, he had also the\nhighest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession,\nintended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years\nsince I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The\nvicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to\nguard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the\nobservation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who\nhad opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy\ncould not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you\nonly can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has\ncreated, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding\nhis real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father\ndied about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the\nlast so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to\npromote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might\nallow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living\nmight be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of\none thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine; and\nwithin half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me\nthat, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should\nnot think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate\npecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be\nbenefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I\nmust be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very\ninsufficient support therein. I rather wished than believed him to be\nsincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his\nproposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman. The\nbusiness was therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistance\nin the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to\nreceive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection\nbetween us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him\nto Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town, I believe, he\nchiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being\nnow free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and\ndissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the\ndecease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,\nhe applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His\ncircumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it,\nwere exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,\nand was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present\nhim to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little\ndoubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,\nand I could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will\nhardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for\nresisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in proportion to\nthe distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in\nhis abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this\nperiod, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived, I\nknow not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my\nnotice. I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget\nmyself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me\nto unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of\nyour secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left\nto the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and\nmyself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an\nestablishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with\nthe lady who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr.\nWickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior\nacquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were\nmost unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far\nrecommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a\nstrong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was\npersuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement. She\nwas then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her\nimprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to\nherself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended\nelopement; and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving\nand offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,\nacknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I\nacted. Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public\nexposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately,\nand Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham’s\nchief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty\nthousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging\nhimself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been\ncomplete indeed. This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in\nwhich we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely\nreject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty\ntowards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of\nfalsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be\nwondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning\neither. Detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly\nnot in your inclination. You may possibly wonder why all this was not\ntold you last night. But I was not then master enough of myself to know\nwhat could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here\nrelated, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel\nFitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and\nstill more as one of the executors of my father’s will, has been\nunavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If\nyour abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you\ncannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and\nthat there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour\nto find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the\ncourse of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.",
      "“FITZWILLIAM DARCY.”\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nElizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to\ncontain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of\nits contents. But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly\nshe went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.\nHer feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did\nshe first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;\nand steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to\ngive, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong\nprejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of\nwhat had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which\nhardly left her power of comprehension; and from impatience of knowing\nwhat the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the\nsense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister’s\ninsensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the\nreal, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any\nwish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done\nwhich satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all\npride and insolence.",
      "But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when\nshe read, with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events which,\nif true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which\nbore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her feelings\nwere yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.\nAstonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished\nto discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false!\nThis cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she had\ngone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the\nlast page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not\nregard it, that she would never look in it again.",
      "In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\nnothing, she walked on; but it would not do: in half a minute the letter\nwas unfolded again; and collecting herself as well as she could, she\nagain began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and\ncommanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.\nThe account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly\nwhat he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,\nthough she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his\nown words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to\nthe will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living\nwas fresh in her memory; and as she recalled his very words, it was\nimpossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the\nother, and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did\nnot err. But when she read and re-read, with the closest attention, the\nparticulars immediately following of Wickham’s resigning all pretensions\nto the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three\nthousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the\nletter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be\nimpartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with\nlittle success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on.\nBut every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had\nbelieved it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to\nrender Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a\nturn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.",
      "The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to\nMr. Wickham’s charge exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could\nbring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his\nentrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at the\npersuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,\nhad there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life,\nnothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“Meeting accidentally in Town”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]",
      "himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power,\nshe had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and\nmanner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.\nShe tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished\ntrait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the\nattacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone\nfor those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class what\nMr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’\ncontinuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him\ninstantly before her, in every charm of air and address, but she could\nremember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the\nneighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in\nthe mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once\nmore continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his\ndesigns on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed\nbetween Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at\nlast she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel\nFitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the\ninformation of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs and whose\ncharacter she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost\nresolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness\nof the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that\nMr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been\nwell assured of his cousin’s corroboration.",
      "She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation\nbetween Wickham and herself in their first evening at Mr. Philips’s.\nMany of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_\nstruck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and\nwondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting\nhimself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions\nwith his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear\nof seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that\n_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball\nthe very next week. She remembered, also, that till the Netherfield\nfamily had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but\nherself; but that after their removal, it had been everywhere discussed;\nthat he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy’s\ncharacter, though he had assured her that respect for the father would\nalways prevent his exposing the son.",
      "How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His\nattentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and\nhatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer\nthe moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.\nHis behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive: he had\neither been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying\nhis vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most\nincautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter\nand fainter; and in further justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not\nbut allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago\nasserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that, proud and repulsive as\nwere his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their\nacquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much\ntogether, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything\nthat betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him\nof irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was\nesteemed and valued;--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a\nbrother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his\nsister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his\nactions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of\neverything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and\nthat friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man\nas Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible.",
      "She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham\ncould she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,\nprejudiced, absurd.\n\n“How despicably have I acted!” she cried. “I, who have prided myself on\nmy discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have\noften disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my\nvanity in useless or blameless distrust. How humiliating is this\ndiscovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not\nhave been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my\nfolly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect\nof the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted\nprepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either were\nconcerned. Till this moment, I never knew myself.”",
      "From herself to Jane, from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line\nwhich soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s explanation\n_there_ had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. Widely\ndifferent was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that\ncredit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to\ngive in the other? He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious\nof her sister’s attachment; and she could not help remembering what\nCharlotte’s opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice\nof his description of Jane. She felt that Jane’s feelings, though\nfervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant\ncomplacency in her air and manner, not often united with great\nsensibility.\n\nWhen she came to that part of the letter in which her family were\nmentioned, in tones of such mortifying, yet merited, reproach, her sense\nof shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly\nfor denial; and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as\nhaving passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first\ndisapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind\nthan on hers.",
      "The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed, but\nit could not console her for the contempt which had been thus\nself-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that\nJane’s disappointment had, in fact, been the work of her nearest\nrelations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt\nby such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she\nhad ever known before.\n\nAfter wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every\nvariety of thought, reconsidering events, determining probabilities, and\nreconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so\nimportant, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at\nlength return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing\ncheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as\nmust make her unfit for conversation.\n\nShe was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each\ncalled during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take\nleave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least\nan hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her\ntill she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in\nmissing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no\nlonger an object. She could think only of her letter.\n\n[Illustration:",
      "“His parting obeisance”\n]\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having\nbeen in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was\nable to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very\ngood health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the\nmelancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then\nhastened to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return\nbrought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship,\nimporting that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of\nhaving them all to dine with her.\n\nElizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had\nshe chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her\nfuture niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her\nLadyship’s indignation would have been. “What would she have said? how\nwould she have behaved?” were the questions with which she amused\nherself.",
      "Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings’ party. “I assure\nyou, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe nobody\nfeels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly\nattached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!\nThey were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear\nColonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy\nseemed to feel it most acutely--more, I think, than last year. His\nattachment to Rosings certainly increases.”\n\nMr. Collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here, which\nwere kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.\n\nLady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of\nspirits; and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that\nshe did not like to go home again so soon, she added,--\n\n“But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you\nmay stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your\ncompany, I am sure.”\n\n“I am much obliged to your Ladyship for your kind invitation,” replied\nElizabeth; “but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town\nnext Saturday.”",
      "“Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected\nyou to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There\ncan be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly\nspare you for another fortnight.”\n\n“But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.”\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“Dawson”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n“Oh, your father, of course, may spare you, if your mother can.\nDaughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will\nstay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you\nas far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and\nas Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good\nroom for one of you--and, indeed, if the weather should happen to be\ncool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you\nlarge.”\n\n“You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our\noriginal plan.”",
      "Lady Catherine seemed resigned. “Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant\nwith them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea\nof two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.\nYou must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the\nworld to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly\nguarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my\nniece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her\nhaving two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr.\nDarcy of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with\npropriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those\nthings. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am\nglad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be\ndiscreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.”\n\n“My uncle is to send a servant for us.”\n\n“Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you\nhave somebody who thinks of those things. Where shall you change horses?\nOh, Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be\nattended to.”",
      "Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey;\nand as she did not answer them all herself attention was\nnecessary--which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a\nmind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection\nmust be reserved for solitary hours: whenever she was alone, she gave\nway to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a\nsolitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of\nunpleasant recollections.",
      "Mr. Darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She\nstudied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at\ntimes widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,\nshe was still full of indignation: but when she considered how unjustly\nshe had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against\nherself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.\nHis attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect: but she\ncould not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or\nfeel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past\nbehaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret: and in\nthe unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.\nThey were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at\nthem, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his\nyoungest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right\nherself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently\nunited with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine\nand Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence,\nwhat chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,\nirritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been always\naffronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would\nscarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While\nthere was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while\nMeryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for\never.",
      "Anxiety on Jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy’s\nexplanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,\nheightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to\nhave been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any\ncould attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How\ngrievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every\nrespect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had\nbeen deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!\n\nWhen to these recollections was added the development of Wickham’s\ncharacter, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had\nseldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it\nalmost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.\n\nTheir engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of\nher stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent\nthere; and her Ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of\ntheir journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,\nand was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right\nway, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the\nwork of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.",
      "When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them\na good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;\nand Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to courtesy and hold out\nher hand to both.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“The elevation of his feelings.”\n]\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nOn Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few\nminutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of\npaying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.\n\n“I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has yet\nexpressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very\ncertain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for\nit. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know\nhow little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain\nmanner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we\nsee of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like\nyourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,\nand that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending\nyour time unpleasantly.”",
      "Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had\nspent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with\nCharlotte, and the kind attention she had received, must make _her_ feel\nthe obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling\nsolemnity replied,--\n\n“It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your\ntime not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most\nfortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior\nsociety, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of\nvarying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that\nyour Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation\nwith regard to Lady Catherine’s family is, indeed, the sort of\nextraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on\nwhat a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In\ntruth, I must acknowledge, that, with all the disadvantages of this\nhumble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of\ncompassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”\n\nWords were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was\nobliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility\nand truth in a few short sentences.",
      "“You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into\nHertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself, at least, that you will\nbe able to do so. Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you\nhave been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear\nthat your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be\nas well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,\nthat I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in\nmarriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of\nthinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of\ncharacter and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each\nother.”\n\nElizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was\nthe case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed\nand rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to\nhave the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from\nwhom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such\nsociety! But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently\nregretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for\ncompassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry,\nand all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.",
      "At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels\nplaced within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate\nparting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by\nMr. Collins; and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning\nher with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks\nfor the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his\ncompliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed\nher in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,\nwhen he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had\nhitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“They had forgotten to leave any message”\n]\n\n“But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble respects\ndelivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you\nwhile you have been here.”\n\nElizabeth made no objection: the door was then allowed to be shut, and\nthe carriage drove off.\n\n“Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes’ silence, “it seems\nbut a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have\nhappened!”\n\n“A great many indeed,” said her companion, with a sigh.\n\n“We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!\nHow much I shall have to tell!”",
      "Elizabeth privately added, “And how much I shall have to conceal!”\n\nTheir journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and\nwithin four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner’s\nhouse, where they were to remain a few days.\n\nJane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her\nspirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt\nhad reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at\nLongbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.\n\nIt was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for\nLongbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy’s proposals. To know\nthat she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish\nJane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own\nvanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation\nto openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision\nin which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate,\nand her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into\nrepeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister\nfurther.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“How nicely we are crammed in”\n]\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out\ntogether from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;\nand, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet’s carriage was\nto meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman’s\npunctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs.\nThese two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed\nin visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and\ndressing a salad and cucumber.\n\nAfter welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set\nout with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,\n“Is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?”\n\n“And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia; “but you must lend us the\nmoney, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then showing\nher purchases,--“Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it\nis very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall\npull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any\nbetter.”",
      "And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect\nunconcern, “Oh, but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and\nwhen I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I\nthink it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what\none wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they\nare going in a fortnight.”\n\n“Are they, indeed?” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.\n\n“They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to\ntake us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme,\nand I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to\ngo, too, of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall\nhave!”\n\n“Yes,” thought Elizabeth; “_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,\nand completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton and a whole\ncampful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor\nregiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!”\n\n“Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down to\ntable. “What do you think? It is excellent news, capital news, and about\na certain person that we all like.”\n\nJane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he\nneed not stay. Lydia laughed, and said,--",
      "“Ay, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the\nwaiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse\nthings said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad\nhe is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for\nmy news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?\nThere is no danger of Wickham’s marrying Mary King--there’s for you! She\nis gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay. Wickham is safe.”\n\n“And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection\nimprudent as to fortune.”\n\n“She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”\n\n“But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said Jane.\n\n“I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared\nthree straws about her. Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled\nthing?”\n\nElizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such\ncoarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_\nwas little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied\nliberal!\n\nAs soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was\nordered; and, after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their\nboxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty’s and\nLydia’s purchases, were seated in it.",
      "“How nicely we are crammed in!” cried Lydia. “I am glad I brought my\nbonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another band-box! Well, now\nlet us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way\nhome. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all\nsince you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any\nflirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband\nbefore you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.\nShe is almost three-and-twenty! Lord! how ashamed I should be of not\nbeing married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to\nget husbands you can’t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.\nCollins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!\nhow I should like to be married before any of you! and then I would\n_chaperon_ you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece\nof fun the other day at Colonel Forster’s! Kitty and me were to spend\nthe day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the\nevening; (by-the-bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so\nshe asked the two Harringtons to come: but Harriet was ill, and so Pen\nwas forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We\ndressed up Chamberlayne in woman’s clothes, on purpose to pass for a\nlady,--only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.\nForster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow\none of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,\nand Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they\ndid not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.\nForster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect\nsomething, and then they soon found out what was the matter.”",
      "With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did Lydia,\nassisted by Kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her\ncompanions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she\ncould, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham’s name.\n\nTheir reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane\nin undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet\nsay voluntarily to Elizabeth,----\n\n“I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”\n\nTheir party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases\ncame to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects\nwhich occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, across the\ntable, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet\nwas doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present\nfashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,\nretailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice\nrather louder than any other person’s, was enumerating the various\npleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.",
      "“Oh, Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!\nas we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended\nthere was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if\nKitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we\nbehaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest\ncold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have\ntreated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought\nwe never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter.\nAnd then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so\nloud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”\n\nTo this, Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister,\nto depreciate such pleasures. They would doubtless be congenial with the\ngenerality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for\n_me_. I should infinitely prefer a book.”\n\nBut of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to\nanybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.",
      "In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to\nMeryton, and see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed\nthe scheme. It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at\nhome half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was\nanother reason, too, for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Wickham\nagain, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to\n_her_, of the regiment’s approaching removal, was indeed beyond\nexpression. In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped\nthere could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\n\nShe had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton\nscheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under\nfrequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her\nfather had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were\nat the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often\ndisheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nElizabeth’s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no\nlonger be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular\nin which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,\nshe related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr.\nDarcy and herself.",
      "Miss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly\npartiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly\nnatural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was\nsorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so\nlittle suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the\nunhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given him.\n\n“His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly\nought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his\ndisappointment.”\n\n“Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has\nother feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.\nYou do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”\n\n“Blame you! Oh, no.”\n\n“But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”\n\n“No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”\n\n“But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very\nnext day.”",
      "She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far\nas they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane,\nwho would willingly have gone through the world without believing that\nso much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here\ncollected in one individual! Nor was Darcy’s vindication, though\ngrateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.\nMost earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and\nseek to clear one, without involving the other.\n\n“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both\nof them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied\nwith only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just\nenough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting\nabout pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.\nDarcy’s, but you shall do as you choose.”\n\nIt was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.\n\n“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham so\nvery bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy,\nonly consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and\nwith the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a\nthing of his sister! It is really too distressing, I am sure you must\nfeel it so.”",
      "“Oh no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full\nof both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing\nevery moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me\nsaving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as\nlight as a feather.”\n\n“Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his\ncountenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner.”\n\n“There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those\ntwo young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the\nappearance of it.”\n\n“I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you\nused to do.”\n\n“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike\nto him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one’s genius, such an\nopening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually\nabusive without saying anything just; but one cannot be always laughing\nat a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”\n\n“Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat\nthe matter as you do now.”\n\n“Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I was very\nuncomfortable--I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to of what I\nfelt, no Jane to comfort me, and say that I had not been so very weak,\nand vain, and nonsensical, as I knew I had! Oh, how I wanted you!”",
      "“How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions\nin speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly\nundeserved.”\n\n“Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most\nnatural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is\none point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I\nought, or ought not, to make our acquaintance in general understand\nWickham’s character.”\n\nMiss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can be no\noccasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your own opinion?”\n\n“That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorized me to\nmake his communication public. On the contrary, every particular\nrelative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to\nmyself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his\nconduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is\nso violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in\nMeryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to\nit. Wickham will soon be gone; and, therefore, it will not signify to\nanybody here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found\nout, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.\nAt present I will say nothing about it.”",
      "“You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for\never. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to\nre-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.”\n\nThe tumult of Elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation. She\nhad got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a\nfortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she\nmight wish to talk again of either. But there was still something\nlurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not\nrelate the other half of Mr. Darcy’s letter, nor explain to her sister\nhow sincerely she had been valued by his friend. Here was knowledge in\nwhich no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than\na perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in\nthrowing off this last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she, “if\nthat very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be\nable to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner\nhimself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost\nall its value!”",
      "She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real\nstate of her sister’s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a\nvery tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in\nlove before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from\nher age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often\nboast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to\nevery other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the\nfeelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those\nregrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their\ntranquillity.\n\n“Well, Lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet, one day, “what is your opinion _now_ of\nthis sad business of Jane’s? For my part, I am determined never to speak\nof it again to anybody. I told my sister Philips so the other day. But I\ncannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a\nvery undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least\nchance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his\ncoming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of\neverybody, too, who is likely to know.”\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“I am determined never to speak of it again”\n]\n\n“I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more.”",
      "“Oh, well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come; though I\nshall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and, if I was\nher, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure\nJane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he\nhas done.”\n\nBut as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she\nmade no answer.\n\n“Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the\nCollinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it\nwill last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an\nexcellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother,\nshe is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_\nhousekeeping, I dare say.”\n\n“No, nothing at all.”\n\n“A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. _They_ will\ntake care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed\nfor money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often\ntalk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it\nquite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.”\n\n“It was a subject which they could not mention before me.”",
      "“No; it would have been strange if they had. But I make no doubt they\noften talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an\nestate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. _I_ should be\nashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“When Colonel Miller’s regiment went away”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was\nthe last of the regiment’s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in\nthe neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost\nuniversal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,\nand sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very\nfrequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and\nLydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such\nhard-heartedness in any of the family.\n\n“Good Heaven! What is to become of us? What are we to do?” would they\noften exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “How can you be smiling so,\nLizzy?”\n\nTheir affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what\nshe had herself endured on a similar occasion five-and-twenty years ago.\n\n“I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together when Colonel\nMiller’s regiment went away. I thought I should have broke my heart.”\n\n“I am sure I shall break _mine_,” said Lydia.",
      "“If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.\n\n“Oh yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.”\n\n“A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.”\n\n“And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,”\nadded Kitty.\n\nSuch were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through\nLongbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense\nof pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy’s\nobjections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his\ninterference in the views of his friend.\n\nBut the gloom of Lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she\nreceived an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the\nregiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a\nvery young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good-humour\nand good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of\ntheir _three_ months’ acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.",
      "The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,\nthe delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely\nto be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings, Lydia flew\nabout the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone’s\ncongratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;\nwhilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate\nin terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.\n\n“I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,”\nsaid she, “though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much\nright to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.”",
      "In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make\nher resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from\nexciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she\nconsidered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense\nfor the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her, were it\nknown, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her\ngo. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia’s general\nbehaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of\nsuch a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more\nimprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must\nbe greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said,--\n\n“Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public\nplace or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little\nexpense or inconvenience to her family as under the present\ncircumstances.”\n\n“If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to\nus all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia’s unguarded and\nimprudent manner, nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you\nwould judge differently in the affair.”",
      "“Already arisen!” repeated Mr. Bennet. “What! has she frightened away\nsome of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such\nsqueamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity\nare not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows\nwho have been kept aloof by Lydia’s folly.”",
      "“Indeed, you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not\nof peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our\nimportance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the\nwild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark\nLydia’s character. Excuse me,--for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear\nfather, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and\nof teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of\nher life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character\nwill be fixed; and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt\nthat ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt, too, in the\nworst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond\nyouth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of\nher mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal\ncontempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty\nis also comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,\nignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh, my dear father, can you\nsuppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever\nthey are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the\ndisgrace?”\n\nMr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and,\naffectionately taking her hand, said, in reply,--",
      "“Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known,\nyou must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less\nadvantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly\nsisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to\nBrighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will\nkeep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an\nobject of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance\neven as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find\nwomen better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being\nthere may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow\nmany degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest\nof her life.”\n\nWith this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion\ncontinued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not\nin her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them.\nShe was confident of having performed her duty; and to fret over\nunavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her\ndisposition.",
      "Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her\nfather, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their\nunited volubility. In Lydia’s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised\nevery possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye\nof fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.\nShe saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at\npresent unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp: its tents\nstretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young\nand the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she\nsaw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six\nofficers at once.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“Tenderly flirting”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\nHad she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and\nsuch realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could\nhave been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the\nsame. Lydia’s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the\nmelancholy conviction of her husband’s never intending to go there\nhimself.\n\nBut they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures\ncontinued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia’s leaving\nhome.",
      "Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been\nfrequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty\nwell over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even\nlearnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,\nan affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present\nbehaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure;\nfor the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which\nhad marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after\nwhat had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in\nfinding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous\ngallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the\nreproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever\ncause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,\nand her preference secured, at any time, by their renewal.",
      "On the very last day of the regiment’s remaining in Meryton, he dined,\nwith others of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth\ndisposed to part from him in good-humour, that, on his making some\ninquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she\nmentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr. Darcy’s having both spent three\nweeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.\n\nHe looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but, with a moment’s\nrecollection, and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen\nhim often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,\nasked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.\nWith an air of indifference, he soon afterwards added, “How long did you\nsay that he was at Rosings?”\n\n“Nearly three weeks.”\n\n“And you saw him frequently?”\n\n“Yes, almost every day.”\n\n“His manners are very different from his cousin’s.”\n\n“Yes, very different; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.”\n\n“Indeed!” cried Wickham, with a look which did not escape her. “And pray\nmay I ask--” but checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is it in\naddress that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his\nordinary style? for I dare not hope,” he continued, in a lower and more\nserious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”",
      "“Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very much\nwhat he ever was.”\n\nWhile she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to\nrejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning. There was a\nsomething in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive\nand anxious attention, while she added,--\n\n“When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that\neither his mind or manners were in a state of improvement; but that,\nfrom knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”\n\nWickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated\nlook; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his\nembarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of\naccents,--",
      "“You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily\ncomprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume\neven the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,\nmay be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter\nhim from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that\nthe sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is\nmerely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and\njudgment he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I\nknow, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his\nwish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he\nhas very much at heart.”\n\nElizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a\nslight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on\nthe old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge\nhim. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,\nof usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish\nElizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a\nmutual desire of never meeting again.",
      "When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,\nfrom whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation\nbetween her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the\nonly one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.\nBennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,\nand impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the\nopportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible,--advice which there\nwas every reason to believe would be attended to; and, in the clamorous\nhappiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus\nof her sisters were uttered without being heard.\n\n[Illustration:\n\nThe arrival of the\nGardiners\n]\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "Had Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could\nnot have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic\ncomfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance\nof good-humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a\nwoman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in\ntheir marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,\nesteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of\ndomestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a\ndisposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own\nimprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often\nconsole the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of\nthe country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal\nenjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as\nher ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not\nthe sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his\nwife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true\nphilosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.",
      "Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her\nfather’s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but\nrespecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of\nherself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to\nbanish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation\nand decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own\nchildren, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so\nstrongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so\nunsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising\nfrom so ill-judged a direction of talents--talents which, rightly used,\nmight at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even\nif incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.",
      "When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure, she found little\nother cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties\nabroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and\nsister, whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around\nthem threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty\nmight in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers\nof her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition\ngreater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her\nfolly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a\nwatering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what\nhas been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked\nforward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the\nsatisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to\nname some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have\nsome other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by\nagain enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the\npresent, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes\nwas now the object of her happiest thoughts: it was her best consolation\nfor all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother\nand Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the\nscheme, every part of it would have been perfect.",
      "“But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for.\nWere the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.\nBut here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my\nsister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of\npleasure realized. A scheme of which every part promises delight can\nnever be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by\nthe defence of some little peculiar vexation.”\n\nWhen Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely\nto her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and\nalways very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that\nthey were just returned from the library, where such and such officers\nhad attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as\nmade her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which\nshe would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a\nviolent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the\ncamp; and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less\nto be learnt, for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much\ntoo full of lines under the words to be made public.",
      "After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,\ngood-humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything\nwore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter\ncame back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs.\nBennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and by the middle\nof June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton\nwithout tears,--an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth\nhope, that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably\nreasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by\nsome cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment\nshould be quartered in Meryton.",
      "The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast\napproaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter\narrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and\ncurtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from\nsetting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again\nwithin a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so\nfar, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with\nthe leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up\nthe Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the\npresent plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that\ncounty there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three\nweeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The\ntown where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where\nthey were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of\nher curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,\nDovedale, or the Peak.\n\nElizabeth was excessively disappointed: she had set her heart on seeing\nthe Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. But it\nwas her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;\nand all was soon right again.",
      "With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It was\nimpossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its\nowner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity,\nand rob it of a few petrified spars, without his perceiving me.”\n\nThe period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away\nbefore her uncle and aunt’s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and\nMrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at\nLongbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two\nyounger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin\nJane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and\nsweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every\nway--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.\n\nThe Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next\nmorning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One\nenjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a\nsuitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear\ninconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection\nand intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were\ndisappointments abroad.",
      "It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,\nnor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither\nlay--Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc., are\nsufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present\nconcern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’s\nformer residence, and where she had lately learned that some\nacquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen\nall the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of\nLambton, Elizabeth found, from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated. It\nwas not in their direct road; nor more than a mile or two out of it. In\ntalking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an\ninclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his\nwillingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.\n\n“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so\nmuch?” said her aunt. “A place, too, with which so many of your\nacquaintance are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you\nknow.”\n\nElizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at\nPemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She\nmust own that she was tired of great houses: after going over so many,\nshe really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.",
      "Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house\nrichly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but the\ngrounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the\ncountry.”\n\nElizabeth said no more; but her mind could not acquiesce. The\npossibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly\noccurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and\nthought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such\na risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved\nthat it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries as to the\nabsence of the family were unfavourably answered.\n\nAccordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid\nwhether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its\nproprietor, and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for\nthe summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question; and her\nalarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\ncuriosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the\nnext morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and\nwith a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike\nto the scheme.\n\nTo Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“Conjecturing as to the date”\n]\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of\nPemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned\nin at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.\n\nThe park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They\nentered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through\na beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.\n\nElizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired\nevery remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for\nhalf a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable\neminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by\nPemberley House, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into which\nthe road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone\nbuilding, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high\nwoody hills; and in front a stream of some natural importance was\nswelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks\nwere neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She\nhad never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural\nbeauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were\nall of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that\nto be mistress of Pemberley might be something!",
      "They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,\nwhile examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of\nmeeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been\nmistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the\nhall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to\nwonder at her being where she was.",
      "The housekeeper came; a respectable looking elderly woman, much less\nfine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They\nfollowed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned\nroom, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went\nto a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from\nwhich they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the\ndistance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was\ngood; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered\non its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace\nit, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were\ntaking different positions; but from every window there were beauties\nto be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture\nsuitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with\nadmiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly\nfine,--with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the\nfurniture of Rosings.",
      "“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With\nthese rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted! Instead of\nviewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and\nwelcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But, no,” recollecting\nherself, “that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to\nme; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”\n\nThis was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.\n\nShe longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really\nabsent, but had not courage for it. At length, however, the question was\nasked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds\nreplied, that he was; adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with a large\nparty of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had\nnot by any circumstance been delayed a day!\n\nHer aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached, and saw\nthe likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other\nminiatures, over the mantel-piece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how\nshe liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the\npicture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, who\nhad been brought up by him at his own expense. “He is now gone into the\narmy,” she added; “but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.”",
      "Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not\nreturn it.\n\n“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,\n“is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the\nother--about eight years ago.”\n\n“I have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner,\nlooking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell\nus whether it is like or not.”\n\nMrs. Reynolds’ respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\nintimation of her knowing her master.\n\n“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”\n\nElizabeth coloured, and said, “A little.”\n\n“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”\n\n“Yes, very handsome.”\n\n“I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you\nwill see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late\nmaster’s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to\nbe then. He was very fond of them.”\n\nThis accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.\n\nMrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn\nwhen she was only eight years old.\n\n“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mr. Gardiner.",
      "“Oh, yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so\naccomplished! She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a\nnew instrument just come down for her--a present from my master: she\ncomes here to-morrow with him.”\n\nMr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her\ncommunicativeness by his questions and remarks: Mrs. Reynolds, either\nfrom pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her\nmaster and his sister.\n\n“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”\n\n“Not so much as I could wish, sir: but I dare say he may spend half his\ntime here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”\n\n“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”\n\n“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”\n\n“Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is\ngood enough for him.”\n\nMr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is\nvery much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”\n\n“I say no more than the truth, and what everybody will say that knows\nhim,” replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;\nand she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,\n“I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him\never since he was four years old.”",
      "This was praise of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her\nideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.\nHer keenest attention was awakened: she longed to hear more; and was\ngrateful to her uncle for saying,--\n\n“There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in\nhaving such a master.”\n\n“Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not\nmeet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are\ngood-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he\nwas always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the\nworld.”\n\nElizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.\n\n“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.\n\n“Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just\nas affable to the poor.”\n\nElizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.\nReynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects\nof the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the\nfurniture in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family\nprejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her\nmaster, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his\nmany merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.",
      "“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever\nlived. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but\nthemselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will\ngive him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never\nsaw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle\naway like other young men.”\n\n“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.\n\n“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not\nquite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”\n\n“Perhaps we might be deceived.”\n\n“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”\n\nOn reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shown into a very pretty\nsitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than\nthe apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to\ngive pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when\nlast at Pemberley.\n\n“He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards\none of the windows.\n\nMrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should enter\nthe room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added. “Whatever\ncan give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. There\nis nothing he would not do for her.”",
      "The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were\nall that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings:\nbut Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already\nvisible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss\nDarcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and\nalso more intelligible.\n\nIn the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have\nlittle to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest\nof the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it\narrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with\nsuch a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,\nwhen he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in\nearnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the\ngallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his\nfather’s lifetime.",
      "There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more gentle\nsensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of\ntheir acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds\nwas of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise\nof an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she\nconsidered how many people’s happiness were in his guardianship! How\nmuch of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! How much of good\nor evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by\nthe housekeeper was favourable to his character; and as she stood before\nthe canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon\nherself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude\nthan it had ever raised before: she remembered its warmth, and softened\nits impropriety of expression.\n\nWhen all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,\nthey returned down stairs; and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were\nconsigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.\n\nAs they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back\nto look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also; and while the former was\nconjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself\nsuddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables.",
      "They were within twenty yards of each other; and so abrupt was his\nappearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes\ninstantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest\nblush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from\nsurprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,\nand spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least\nof perfect civility.",
      "She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\nreceived his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be\novercome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture\nthey had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two\nthat they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise, on\nbeholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little\naloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\nscarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she\nreturned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the\nalteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he\nuttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\nimpropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few\nminutes in which they continued together were some of the most\nuncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he\nspoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his\ninquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay\nin Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the\ndistraction of his thoughts.\n\nAt length, every idea seemed to fail him; and after standing a few\nmoments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took\nleave.",
      "The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his\nfigure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own\nfeelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and\nvexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged\nthing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a\ndisgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if\nshe had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?\nor, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been\nonly ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his\ndiscrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that\nmoment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and\nagain over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so\nstrikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to\nher was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her\nfamily! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,\nnever had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.\nWhat a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when\nhe put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to\naccount for it.",
      "They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and\nevery step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer\nreach of the woods to which they were approaching: but it was some time\nbefore Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered\nmechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed\nto direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she\ndistinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that\none spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\nwas. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in\nwhat manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,\nshe was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he\nfelt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was\nnot like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing\nher, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with\ncomposure.\n\nAt length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind\nroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.",
      "They entered the woods, and, bidding adieu to the river for a while,\nascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening\nof the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of\nthe valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods\noverspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner\nexpressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be\nbeyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten\nmiles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed\ncircuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among\nhanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.\nThey crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of\nthe scene: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and\nthe valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the\nstream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered\nit. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed\nthe bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,\nwho was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of\nreturning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,\ntherefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\non the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\nprogress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\ntaste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the\noccasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man\nabout them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this\nslow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was\nquite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy\napproaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less\nsheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they\nmet. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an\ninterview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\ncalmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,\nshe felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea\nlasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the\nturning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw that\nhe had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness,\nshe began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not\ngot beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky\nrecollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from\nher might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said\nno more.",
      "Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked\nher if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.\nThis was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and\nshe could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the\nacquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had\nrevolted, in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought\nshe, “when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of\nfashion.”\n\nThe introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their\nrelationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore\nit; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he\ncould from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the\nconnection was evident: he sustained it, however, with fortitude: and,\nso far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into\nconversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,\ncould not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some\nrelations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\nattentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\nexpression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,\nhis taste, or his good manners.",
      "The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy\ninvite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he\nchose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same\ntime to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\nthe stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was\nwalking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her\nwonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the\ncompliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was\nextreme; and continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From\nwhat can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake\nthat his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not\nwork such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love\nme.”",
      "After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two\ngentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the\nbrink of the river for the better inspection of some curious\nwater-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in\nMrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found\nElizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred\nher husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on\ntogether. After a short silence the lady first spoke. She wished him to\nknow that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the\nplace, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\nvery unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that\nyou would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before we\nleft Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in\nthe country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that\nbusiness with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours\nbefore the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They\nwill join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some\nwho will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”",
      "Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly\ndriven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been last mentioned\nbetween them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was\nnot very differently engaged.\n\n“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a\npause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow\nme, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance\nduring your stay at Lambton?”\n\nThe surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great\nfor her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt\nthat whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,\nmust be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was\nsatisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made\nhim think really ill of her.\n\nThey now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth\nwas not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and\npleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of\nthe highest kind. They soon outstripped the others; and when they had\nreached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a\nmile behind.",
      "He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not\ntired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might\nhave been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but\nthere seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that\nshe had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with\ngreat perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience\nand her ideas were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.\n\nOn Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go into\nthe house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they\nparted on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the\nladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him\nwalking slowly towards the house.\n\nThe observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them\npronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.\n\n“He is perfectly well-behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.\n\n“There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her\naunt; “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now\nsay with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,\n_I_ have seen nothing of it.”",
      "“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more\nthan civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such\nattention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”\n\n“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham;\nor rather he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his features are\nperfectly good. But how came you to tell us that he was so\ndisagreeable?”\n\nElizabeth excused herself as well as she could: said that she had liked\nhim better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never\nseen him so pleasant as this morning.\n\n“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied\nher uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him\nat his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and\nwarn me off his grounds.”\n\nElizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said\nnothing.",
      "“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really\nshould not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by\nanybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.\nOn the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he\nspeaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would\nnot give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the\ngood lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character!\nI could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal\nmaster, I suppose, and _that_, in the eye of a servant, comprehends\nevery virtue.”\n\nElizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of\nhis behaviour to Wickham; and, therefore, gave them to understand, in as\nguarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his\nrelations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different\nconstruction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor\nWickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In\nconfirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\ntransactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming\nher authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.",
      "Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned: but as they were now\napproaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to\nthe charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out\nto her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of\nanything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk, they had\nno sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former\nacquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an\nintercourse renewed after many years’ discontinuance.\n\nThe occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth\nmuch attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing\nbut think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s civility, and, above\nall, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit\nher the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was, consequently,\nresolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.\nBut her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own\narrival at Lambton these visitors came. They had been walking about the\nplace with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn\nto dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a\ncarriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a\ncurricle driving up the street. Elizabeth, immediately recognizing the\nlivery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise\nto her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she\nexpected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment\nof her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many\nof the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on\nthe business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt\nthat there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such\na quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these\nnewly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of\nElizabeth’s feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed\nat her own discomposure; but, amongst other causes of disquiet, she\ndreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in\nher favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally\nsuspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.",
      "She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked\nup and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of\ninquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.\n\nMiss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction\ntook place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new\nacquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her\nbeing at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;\nbut the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was\nonly exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from\nher beyond a monosyllable.\n\nMiss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though\nlittle more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance\nwomanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there\nwas sense and good-humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\nunassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as\nacute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much\nrelieved by discerning such different feelings.",
      "They had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley was\nalso coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her\nsatisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley’s quick step\nwas heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All\nElizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still\nfelt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected\ncordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He\ninquired in a friendly, though general, way, after her family, and\nlooked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\n\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage\nthan to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before\nthem, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just\narisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards\neach with an earnest, though guarded, inquiry; and they soon drew from\nthose inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what\nit was to love. Of the lady’s sensations they remained a little in\ndoubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was\nevident enough.",
      "Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the\nfeelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to\nmake herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she\nfeared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom\nshe endeavoured to give pleasure were pre-possessed in her favour.\nBingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be\npleased.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“To make herself agreeable to all”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]",
      "In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!\nhow ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a\nlike manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on\nformer occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion\nthat, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,\nthough this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his\nbehaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No\nlook appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing\noccurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On\nthis point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances\noccurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted\na recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of\nsaying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He\nobserved to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and\nin a tone which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long\ntime since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could\nreply, he added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the\n26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”",
      "Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards\ntook occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether\n_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,\nnor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which\ngave them meaning.",
      "It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but\nwhenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general\ncomplaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far\nremoved from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her\nthat the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed,\nhowever temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one\nday. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the\ngood opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would\nhave been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself,\nbut to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected\ntheir last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the\nchange was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could\nhardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the\ncompany of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations\nat Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\nself-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could\nresult from the success of his endeavours, and when even the\nacquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw\ndown the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and\nRosings.",
      "Their visitors stayed with them above half an hour; and when they arose\nto depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing\ntheir wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner\nat Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a\ndiffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,\nreadily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing\nhow _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\nacceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however,\nthat this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than\nany dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of\nsociety, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for\nher attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.",
      "Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth\nagain, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to\nmake after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all\nthis into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and\non this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their\nvisitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some\nsatisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been\nlittle. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her\nuncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their\nfavourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\n\nBut she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity; it was\nnot their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was\nmuch better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;\nit was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to\ninterest, but nothing to justify inquiry.",
      "Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far\nas their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could\nnot be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character\nfrom their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference\nto any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known\nwould not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,\nhowever, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible\nthat the authority of a servant, who had known him since he was four\nyears old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be\nhastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of\ntheir Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had\nnothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,\nit would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town\nwhere the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he\nwas a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.\n\nWith respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held\nthere in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the\nson of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known\nfact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind\nhim, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.",
      "As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than\nthe last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not\nlong enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and\nshe lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She\ncertainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she\nhad almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,\nthat could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his\nvaluable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\ntime ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened\ninto somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his\nfavour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,\nwhich yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,\nthere was a motive within her of good-will which could not be\noverlooked. It was gratitude;--gratitude, not merely for having once\nloved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the\npetulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the\nunjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been\npersuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this\naccidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and\nwithout any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner,\nwhere their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good\nopinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such\na change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but\ngratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, as\nsuch, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no\nmeans unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected,\nshe esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his\nwelfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to\ndepend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both\nthat she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still\npossessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.",
      "It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that\nsuch a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s, in coming to them on the very\nday of her arrival at Pemberley--for she had reached it only to a late\nbreakfast--ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by\nsome exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it\nwould be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following\nmorning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when\nshe asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.\n\nMr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been\nrenewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting\nsome of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“Engaged by the river”\n]\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nConvinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike of her had\noriginated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome\nher appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know\nwith how much civility on that lady’s side the acquaintance would now\nbe renewed.",
      "On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,\nwhose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows,\nopening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody\nhills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts\nwhich were scattered over the intermediate lawn.\n\nIn this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there\nwith Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in\nLondon. Georgiana’s reception of them was very civil, but attended with\nall that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the\nfear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves\ninferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and\nher niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.",
      "By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy; and\non their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,\nsucceeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a\ngenteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind\nof discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the\nothers; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\nElizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she\nwished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\nshort sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.",
      "Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,\nand that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without\ncalling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her\nfrom trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an\ninconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity\nof saying much: her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every\nmoment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room: she wished, she\nfeared, that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\nshe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After\nsitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss\nBingley’s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold\ninquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal\nindifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\n\nThe next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\nentrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the\nfinest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a\nsignificant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been\ngiven, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole\nparty; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\nbeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected\nthem round the table.",
      "While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether\nshe most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the\nfeelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but\na moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to\nregret that he came.",
      "He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other\ngentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river; and had left him\nonly on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to\nGeorgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely\nresolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more\nnecessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\nsaw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\nand that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\nwhen he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive\ncuriosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the\nsmiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\nobjects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\nto Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother’s\nentrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he\nwas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,\nas much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss\nBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\nfirst opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,--\n\n“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?\nThey must be a great loss to _your_ family.”",
      "In Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name: but Elizabeth\ninstantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the\nvarious recollections connected with him gave her a moment’s distress;\nbut, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\npresently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While\nshe spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened\ncomplexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\nconfusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what\npain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have\nrefrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\nElizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed\nher partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in\nDarcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies\nand absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with\nthat corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s\nmeditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy\nwas possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connections\nher brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish\nwhich Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\nhereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan; and without\nmeaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss\nBennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern\nfor the welfare of his friend.",
      "Elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and\nas Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to\nWickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able\nto speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely\nrecollected her interest in the affair; and the very circumstance which\nhad been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have\nfixed them on her more and more cheerfully.\n\nTheir visit did not continue long after the question and answer above\nmentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage,\nMiss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth’s\nperson, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her\nbrother’s recommendation was enough to insure her favour: his judgment\ncould not err; and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave\nGeorgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and\namiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help\nrepeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.\n\n“How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she cried: “I\nnever in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.\nShe is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we\nshould not have known her again.”",
      "However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented\nhimself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than\nher being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the\nsummer.\n\n“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could see\nany beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no\nbrilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants\ncharacter; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are\ntolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which\nhave sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive anything\nextraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not\nlike at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency\nwithout fashion, which is intolerable.”\n\nPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not\nthe best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always\nwise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the\nsuccess she expected. He was resolutely silent, however; and, from a\ndetermination of making him speak, she continued,--",
      "“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all\nwere to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect\nyour saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, ‘_She_\na beauty! I should as soon call her mother a wit.’ But afterwards she\nseemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at\none time.”\n\n“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but _that_\nwas only when I first knew her; for it is many months since I have\nconsidered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”\n\nHe then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of\nhaving forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.\n\nMrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their\nvisit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them\nboth. The looks and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,\nexcept of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked\nof his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of everything but\nhimself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of\nhim, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece’s\nbeginning the subject.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nChapter XLVI.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from\nJane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been\nrenewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on\nthe third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the\nreceipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that\nit had been mis-sent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as\nJane had written the direction remarkably ill.\n\nThey had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her\nuncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by\nthemselves. The one mis-sent must be first attended to; it had been\nwritten five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their\nlittle parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;\nbut the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident\nagitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:--",
      "“Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a\nmost unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be\nassured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.\nAn express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,\nfrom Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland\nwith one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our\nsurprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am\nvery, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing\nto hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.\nThoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and\nlet us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is\ndisinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.\nOur poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How\nthankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said against\nhim; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about\ntwelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at\neight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have\npassed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect\nhim here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of\ntheir intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor\nmother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly\nknow what I have written.”",
      "Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing\nwhat she felt, Elizabeth, on finishing this letter, instantly seized the\nother, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it\nhad been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.",
      "“By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I\nwish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my\nhead is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest\nLizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,\nand it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham\nand our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has\ntaken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone\nto Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the\nday before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia’s short\nletter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna\nGreen, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.\nnever intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated\nto Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.,\nintending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but\nno farther; for on entering that place, they removed into a\nhackney-coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.\nAll that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the\nLondon road. I know not what to think. After making every possible\ninquiry on that side of London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire,\nanxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet\nand Hatfield, but without any success,--no such people had been seen to\npass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and\nbroke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.\nI am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F.; but no one can throw any\nblame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and\nmother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many\ncircumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married\nprivately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_\ncould form such a design against a young woman of Lydia’s connections,\nwhich is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?\nImpossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed\nto depend upon their marriage: he shook his head when I expressed my\nhopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother\nis really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be\nbetter, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in\nmy life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed\ntheir attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot\nwonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared\nsomething of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is\nover, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish,\nhowever, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen\nagain to do, what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances\nare such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as\nsoon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not\nafraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of\nthe former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly,\nto try to discover her. What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but\nhis excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the\nbest and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton\nagain to-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle’s advice and\nassistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately\ncomprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”",
      "“Oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat\nas she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a\nmoment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was\nopened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and\nimpetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself\nenough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia’s\nsituation, hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.\nI must find Mr. Gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed;\nI have not an instant to lose.”\n\n“Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than\npoliteness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute;\nbut let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are\nnot well enough; you cannot go yourself.”\n\nElizabeth hesitated; but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how\nlittle would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back\nthe servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an\naccent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and\nmistress home instantly.",
      "On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and\nlooking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,\nor to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,\n“Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you\npresent relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.”\n\n“No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “There\nis nothing the matter with me. I am quite well, I am only distressed by\nsome dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.”\n\nShe burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could\nnot speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say\nsomething indistinctly of his\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“I have not an instant to lose”\n]\n\nconcern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length she spoke\nagain. “I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It\ncannot be concealed from anyone. My youngest sister has left all her\nfriends--has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of--of Mr.\nWickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. _You_ know him too\nwell to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that\ncan tempt him to--she is lost for ever.”\n\nDarcy was fixed in astonishment.",
      "“When I consider,” she added, in a yet more agitated voice, “that _I_\nmight have prevented it! _I_ who knew what he was. Had I but explained\nsome part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had\nhis character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all,\nall too late now.”\n\n“I am grieved, indeed,” cried Darcy: “grieved--shocked. But is it\ncertain, absolutely certain?”\n\n“Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced\nalmost to London, but not beyond: they are certainly not gone to\nScotland.”\n\n“And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?”\n\n“My father has gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle’s\nimmediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour. But\nnothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done. How is\nsuch a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have\nnot the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!”\n\nDarcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.\n\n“When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character, oh! had I known what\nI ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too\nmuch. Wretched, wretched mistake!”",
      "Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up\nand down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air\ngloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power\nwas sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family\nweakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither\nwonder nor condemn; but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing\nconsolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It\nwas, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own\nwishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved\nhim, as now, when all love must be vain.\n\nBut self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the\nhumiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all--soon swallowed up\nevery private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,\nElizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of\nseveral minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the\nvoice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke\ncompassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,--",
      "“I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything\nto plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern.\nWould to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part,\nthat might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment\nyou with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.\nThis unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister’s having the\npleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.”\n\n“Oh, yes! Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that\nurgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as\nlong as it is possible. I know it cannot be long.”\n\nHe readily assured her of his secrecy, again expressed his sorrow for\nher distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present\nreason to hope, and, leaving his compliments for her relations, with\nonly one serious parting look, went away.\n\nAs he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they\nshould ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had\nmarked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a\nretrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of\ncontradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those\nfeelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would\nformerly have rejoiced in its termination.",
      "If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth’s\nchange of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if\notherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or\nunnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a\nfirst interview with its object, and even before two words have been\nexchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given\nsomewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,\nand that its ill success might, perhaps, authorize her to seek the other\nless interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go\nwith regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s infamy must\nproduce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched\nbusiness. Never since reading Jane’s second letter had she entertained a\nhope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,\ncould flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least\nof all her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first\nletter remained on her mind, she was all surprise, all astonishment,\nthat Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry\nfor money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared\nincomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment\nas this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not\nsuppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the\nintention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither\nher virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy\nprey.",
      "She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that\nLydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia had\nwanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one\nofficer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions\nraised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually\nfluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and\nmistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now\nfeel it!",
      "She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to\nshare with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a\nfamily so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and\nrequiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing\ncould be done for Lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmost\nimportance, and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience\nwas severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,\nby the servant’s account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but\nsatisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the\ncause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on\nthe postscript of the last with trembling energy. Though Lydia had never\nbeen a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be\ndeeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after\nthe first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily\npromised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no\nless, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated\nby one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily\nsettled. They were to be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be\ndone about Pemberley?” cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was\nhere when you sent for us;--was it so?”",
      "“Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.\n_That_ is all settled.”\n\n“What is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to\nprepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real\ntruth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”\n\nBut wishes were vain; or, at best, could serve only to amuse her in the\nhurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure\nto be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was\nimpossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of\nbusiness as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to\nbe written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their\nsudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.\nGardiner, meanwhile, having settled his account at the inn, nothing\nremained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of\nthe morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could\nhave supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“The first pleasing earnest of their welcome”\n]\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "“I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they\ndrove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much\nmore inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the\nmatter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form\nsuch a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or\nfriendless, and who was actually staying in his Colonel’s family, that I\nam strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends\nwould not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the\nregiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is\nnot adequate to the risk.”\n\n“Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.\n\n“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle’s\nopinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and\ninterest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of\nWickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzie, so wholly give him up, as to believe\nhim capable of it?”\n\n“Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect\nI can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not\nhope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the\ncase?”\n\n“In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof\nthat they are not gone to Scotland.”",
      "“Oh, but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a\npresumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the\nBarnet road.”\n\n“Well, then,--supposing them to be in London--they may be there, though\nfor the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is\nnot likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it\nmight strike them that they could be more economically, though less\nexpeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.”",
      "“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their\nmarriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular\nfriend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending\nto marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He\ncannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she\nbeyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake\nforego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what\nrestraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a\ndishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know\nnothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your\nother objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no\nbrothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’s\nbehaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever\nseemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would\ndo as little and think as little about it, as any father could do, in\nsuch a matter.”\n\n“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him,\nas to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?”",
      "“It does seem, and it is most shocking, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with\ntears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such\na point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.\nPerhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young: she has never\nbeen taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,\nnay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement\nand vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle\nand frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.\nSince the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,\nflirtation, and officers, have been in her head. She has been doing\neverything in her power, by thinking and talking on the subject, to give\ngreater--what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings; which\nare naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every\ncharm of person and address that can captivate a woman.”\n\n“But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so ill of\nWickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.”",
      "“Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be\ntheir former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,\ntill it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what\nWickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every\nsense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is\nas false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”\n\n“And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity\nas to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\n\n“I do, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you the other day\nof his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at\nLongbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with\nsuch forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other\ncircumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to\nrelate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From\nwhat he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,\nreserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He\nmust know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found\nher.”\n\n“But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you\nand Jane seem so well to understand?”",
      "“Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw\nso much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was\nignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home the ----shire\nwas to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight’s time. As that was the\ncase, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it\nnecessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it\napparently be to anyone, that the good opinion, which all the\nneighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when it\nwas settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of\nopening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could\nbe in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a\nconsequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far\nenough from my thoughts.”\n\n“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I\nsuppose, to believe them fond of each other?”",
      "“Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either\nside; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware\nthat ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first\nhe entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all\nwere. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for\nthe first two months: but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular\nattention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and\nwild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,\nwho treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”\n\nIt may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added\nto their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject by\nits repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during\nthe whole of the journey. From Elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent.\nFixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could\nfind no interval of ease or forgetfulness.\n\nThey travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on\nthe road, reached Longbourn by dinnertime the next day. It was a comfort\nto Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long\nexpectations.",
      "The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing\non the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the\ncarriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their\nfaces and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of\ncapers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.\n\nElizabeth jumped out; and after giving each of them a hasty kiss,\nhurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running downstairs from\nher mother’s apartment, immediately met her.\n\nElizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the\neyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been\nheard of the fugitives.\n\n“Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope\neverything will be well.”\n\n“Is my father in town?”\n\n“Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”\n\n“And have you heard from him often?”\n\n“We have heard only once. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say\nthat he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I\nparticularly begged him to do. He merely added, that he should not write\nagain, till he had something of importance to mention.”\n\n“And my mother--how is she? How are you all?”",
      "“My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly\nshaken. She is upstairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you\nall. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank\nHeaven! are quite well.”\n\n“But you--how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How much you\nmust have gone through!”\n\nHer sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their\nconversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were\nengaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of\nthe whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and\nthanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.\n\nWhen they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth\nhad already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon\nfound that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good,\nhowever, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet\ndeserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that\nevery morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,\nto explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce the marriage.",
      "Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes’\nconversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with\ntears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous\nconduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;\nblaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the\nerrors of her daughter must be principally owing.\n\n“If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to Brighton\nwith all my family, _this_ would not have happened: but poor dear Lydia\nhad nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out\nof their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their\nside, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had\nbeen well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have\nthe charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am. Poor, dear\nchild! And now here’s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight\nWickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is\nto become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold\nin his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what\nwe shall do.”",
      "They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after\ngeneral assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her\nthat he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.\nBennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.\n\n“Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he: “though it is right to be\nprepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.\nIt is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more, we\nmay gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,\nand have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as\nlost. As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him\ncome home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult\ntogether as to what is to be done.”",
      "“Oh, my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what I\ncould most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,\nwherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them\nmarry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but\ntell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,\nafter they are married. And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from\nfighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in--that I am frightened\nout of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings all over me,\nsuch spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at my\nheart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear\nLydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me,\nfor she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how\nkind you are! I know you will contrive it all.”\n\nBut Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours\nin the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in\nher hopes as her fears; and after talking with her in this manner till\ndinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the\nhousekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.",
      "Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real\noccasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to\noppose it; for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her\ntongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it\nbetter that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could\nmost trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the\nsubject.\n\nIn the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been\ntoo busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance\nbefore. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The\nfaces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible\nin either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger\nwhich she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more\nof fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was\nmistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance\nof grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,--\n\n“This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.\nBut we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of\neach other the balm of sisterly consolation.”",
      "Then perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,\n“Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful\nlesson:--that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable, that one\nfalse step involves her in endless ruin, that her reputation is no less\nbrittle than it is beautiful, and that she cannot be too much guarded in\nher behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”\n\nElizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to\nmake any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such\nkind of moral extractions from the evil before them.\n\nIn the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an\nhour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the\nopportunity of making any inquiries which Jane was equally eager to\nsatisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel\nof this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss\nBennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued\nthe subject by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it which I\nhave not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel\nForster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement\ntook place? They must have seen them together for ever.”",
      "“Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,\nespecially on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so\ngrieved for him. His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He\n_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had\nany idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension\nfirst got abroad, it hastened his journey.”\n\n“And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of\ntheir intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?”\n\n“Yes; but when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of\ntheir plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not\nrepeat his persuasion of their not marrying, and from _that_ I am\ninclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before.”\n\n“And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a\ndoubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”",
      "“How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt a\nlittle uneasy--a little fearful of my sister’s happiness with him in\nmarriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite\nright. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how\nimprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural\ntriumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia’s last letter\nshe had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their\nbeing in love with each other many weeks.”\n\n“But not before they went to Brighton?”\n\n“No, I believe not.”\n\n“And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself? Does he\nknow his real character?”\n\n“I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly\ndid. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant; and since this sad\naffair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt:\nbut I hope this may be false.”\n\n“Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,\nthis could not have happened!”\n\n“Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister.\n\n“But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what\ntheir present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.”\n\n“We acted with the best intentions.”\n\n“Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia’s note to his\nwife?”\n\n“He brought it with him for us to see.”",
      "Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These\nwere the contents:--\n\n/* NIND “My dear Harriet, */\n\n“You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help\n     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am\n     missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with\n     who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the\n     world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without\n     him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at\n     Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the\n     surprise the greater when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia\n     Wickham. What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for\n     laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my\n     engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I hope he will\n     excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at\n     the next ball we meet with great pleasure. I shall send for my\n     clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to\n     mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed\n     up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will\n     drink to our good journey.\n\n“Your affectionate friend,\n\n“LYDIA BENNET.”",
      "“Oh, thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she had\nfinished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But\nat least it shows that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.\nWhatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a\n_scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!”\n\n“I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten\nminutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in\nsuch confusion!”\n\n“Oh, Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it who\ndid not know the whole story before the end of the day?”\n\n“I do not know: I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is\nvery difficult. My mother was in hysterics; and though I endeavoured to\ngive her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much\nas I might have done. But the horror of what might possibly happen\nalmost took from me my faculties.”\n\n“Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look\nwell. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety\nupon yourself alone.”",
      "“Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every\nfatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.\nKitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much that her hours of\nrepose should not be broken in on. My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on\nTuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till\nThursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all, and Lady\nLucas has been very kind: she walked here on Wednesday morning to\ncondole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if\nthey could be of use to us.”\n\n“She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth: “perhaps she\n_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too\nlittle of one’s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence,\ninsufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.”\n\nShe then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had\nintended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.",
      "“He meant, I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place where\nthey last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if anything could\nbe made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the\nnumber of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come\nwith a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a\ngentleman and lady’s removing from one carriage into another might be\nremarked, he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow\ndiscover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he\ndetermined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible\nto find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any\nother designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,\nand his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding\nout even so much as this.”\n\n[Illustration:\n\nThe Post\n]\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next\nmorning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.\nHis family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and\ndilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.\nThey were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to\nsend; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.\nGardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.\n\nWhen he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant\ninformation of what was going on; and their uncle promised, at parting,\nto prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn as soon as he could, to\nthe great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only\nsecurity for her husband’s not being killed in a duel.\n\nMrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few\ndays longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to\nher nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a\ngreat comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also\nvisited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of\ncheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without\nreporting some fresh instance of Wickham’s extravagance or irregularity,\nshe seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found\nthem.",
      "All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months\nbefore, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt\nto every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with\nthe title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman’s family.\nEverybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and\neverybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the\nappearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above\nhalf of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of\nher sister’s ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still\nless of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now\ncome, when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before\nentirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some\nnews of them.",
      "Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a\nletter from him: it told them, that on his arrival he had immediately\nfound out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street.\nThat Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but\nwithout gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now\ndetermined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet\nthought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first\ncoming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself\ndid not expect any success from this measure; but as his brother was\neager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added, that Mr.\nBennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London, and\npromised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this\neffect:--",
      "“I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if\npossible, from some of the young man’s intimates in the regiment,\nwhether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to\nknow in what part of the town he has now concealed himself. If there\nwere anyone that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such\na clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have\nnothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in\nhis power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps\nLizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any\nother person.”\n\nElizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for\nher authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any\ninformation of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved.\n\nShe had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father\nand mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible,\nhowever, that some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to\ngive more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting\nit, the application was a something to look forward to.",
      "Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious\npart of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was\nthe first grand object of every morning’s impatience. Through letters,\nwhatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated; and every\nsucceeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.\n\nBut before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for\ntheir father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane\nhad received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,\nshe accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his\nletters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as\nfollows:--\n\n/* “My dear Sir, */",
      "“I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation\n     in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now\n     suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter\n     from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and\n     myself sincerely sympathize with you, and all your respectable\n     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest\n     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No\n     arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe\n     a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that\n     must be, of all others, most afflicting to a parent’s mind. The\n     death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of\n     this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to\n     suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness\n     of behaviour in your\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“To whom I have related the affair”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]",
      "daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though,\n     at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet,\n     I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally\n     bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an\n     age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in\n     which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by\n     Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair.\n     They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one\n     daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others: for\n     who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect\n     themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads me,\n     moreover, to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain\n     event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been\n     involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me advise you, then,\n     my dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off\n     your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to\n     reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.\n\n“I am, dear sir,” etc., etc.",
      "Mr. Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from\nColonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.\nIt was not known that Wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up\nany connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His\nformer acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the\nmilitia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship\nwith any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out\nas likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own\nfinances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to\nhis fear of discovery by Lydia’s relations; for it had just transpired\nthat he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.\nColonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be\nnecessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He owed a good deal in the\ntown, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner\ndid not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family;\nJane heard them with horror. “A gamester!” she cried. “This is wholly\nunexpected; I had not an idea of it.”",
      "Mr. Gardiner added, in his letter, that they might expect to see their\nfather at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered\nspiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to\nhis brother-in-law’s entreaty that he would return to his family and\nleave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable\nfor continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did\nnot express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering\nwhat her anxiety for his life had been before.\n\n“What! is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried. “Sure he\nwill not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,\nand make him marry her, if he comes away?”\n\nAs Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she\nand her children should go to London at the same time that Mr. Bennet\ncame from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their\njourney, and brought its master back to Longbourn.",
      "Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her\nDerbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.\nHis name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;\nand the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of\ntheir being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.\nElizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from\nPemberley.\n\nThe present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for\nthe lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be\nfairly conjectured from _that_,--though Elizabeth, who was by this time\ntolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware\nthat, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of\nLydia’s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,\none sleepless night out of two.\n\nWhen Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual\nphilosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the\nhabit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him\naway; and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of\nit.",
      "It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that\nElizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly\nexpressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “Say\nnothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,\nand I ought to feel it.”\n\n“You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.\n\n“You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to\nfall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have\nbeen to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.\nIt will pass away soon enough.”\n\n“Do you suppose them to be in London?”\n\n“Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”\n\n“And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.\n\n“She is happy, then,” said her father, drily; “and her residence there\nwill probably be of some duration.”\n\nThen, after a short silence, he continued, “Lizzy, I bear you no\nill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which,\nconsidering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”\n\nThey were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother’s\ntea.\n\n“This is a parade,” cried he, “which does one good; it gives such an\nelegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my\nlibrary, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as\nI can,--or perhaps I may defer it till Kitty runs away.”",
      "“I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty, fretfully. “If _I_\nshould ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”\n\n“_You_ go to Brighton! I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne,\nfor fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at least learnt to be cautious, and\nyou will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter my house\nagain, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely\nprohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are\nnever to stir out of doors, till you can prove that you have spent ten\nminutes of every day in a rational manner.”\n\nKitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.\n\n“Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good\ngirl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of\nthem.”\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER XLIX.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nTwo days after Mr. Bennet’s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking\ntogether in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper\ncoming towards them, and concluding that she came to call them to their\nmother, went forward to meet her; but instead of the expected summons,\nwhen they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, “I beg your pardon,\nmadam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some\ngood news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.”",
      "“What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.”\n\n“Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don’t you know\nthere is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here\nthis half hour, and master has had a letter.”\n\nAway ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They\nran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the\nlibrary;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of\nseeking him upstairs with their mother, when they were met by the\nbutler, who said,--\n\n“If you are looking for my master, ma’am, he is walking towards the\nlittle copse.”\n\nUpon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,\nand ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately\npursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.\n\nJane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as\nElizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,\ncame up with him, and eagerly cried out,--\n\n“Oh, papa, what news? what news? have you heard from my uncle?”\n\n“Yes, I have had a letter from him by express.”\n\n“Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?”\n\n“What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter from\nhis pocket; “but perhaps you would like to read it.”\n\nElizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.",
      "“Read it aloud,” said their father, “for I hardly know myself what it is\nabout.”\n\n/* RIGHT “Gracechurch Street, _Monday, August 2_. */\n\n“My dear Brother,\n\n“At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such\n     as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction. Soon after\n     you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what\n     part of London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet.\n     It is enough to know they are discovered: I have seen them\n     both----”\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“But perhaps you would like to read it”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n“Then it is as I always hoped,” cried Jane: “they are married!”",
      "Elizabeth read on: “I have seen them both. They are not married,\n     nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are\n     willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on\n     your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is\n     required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her\n     equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your\n     children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,\n     moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your\n     life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions which,\n     considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with, as\n     far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by\n     express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You\n     will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham’s\n     circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to\n     be. The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to\n     say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are\n     discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.\n     If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act\n     in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will\n     immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper\n     settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming\n     to town again; therefore stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on\n     my diligence and care. Send back your answer as soon as you can,\n     and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that my\n     niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will\n     approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as\n     anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.",
      "“EDW. GARDINER.”\n\n“Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. “Can it be\npossible that he will marry her?”\n\n“Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him,” said her\nsister. “My dear father, I congratulate you.”\n\n“And have you answered the letter?” said Elizabeth.\n\n“No; but it must be done soon.”\n\nMost earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he\nwrote.\n\n“Oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write immediately.\nConsider how important every moment is in such a case.”\n\n“Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble\nyourself.”\n\n“I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”\n\nAnd so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.\n\n“And--may I ask?” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, I suppose, must be\ncomplied with.”\n\n“Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.”\n\n“And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man.”\n\n“Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there\nare two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money\nyour uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever\nto pay him.”\n\n“Money! my uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”\n\n“I mean that no man in his proper senses would marry Lydia on so slight\na temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am\ngone.”",
      "“That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to me\nbefore. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh,\nit must be my uncle’s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has\ndistressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.”\n\n“No,” said her father. “Wickham’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing\nless than ten thousand pounds: I should be sorry to think so ill of him,\nin the very beginning of our relationship.”\n\n“Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be\nrepaid?”\n\nMr. Bennet made no answer; and each of them, deep in thought, continued\nsilent till they reached the house. Their father then went to the\nlibrary to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.\n\n“And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as they\nwere by themselves. “How strange this is! and for _this_ we are to be\nthankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,\nand wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!”\n\n“I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he certainly would\nnot marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind\nuncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten\nthousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children\nof his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand\npounds?”",
      "“If we are ever able to learn what Wickham’s debts have been,” said\nElizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall\nexactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has\nnot sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be\nrequited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal\nprotection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as\nyears of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is\nactually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,\nshe will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she\nfirst sees my aunt!”\n\n“We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said\nJane: “I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry\nher is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of\nthinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself\nthey will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in\ntime make their past imprudence forgotten.”\n\n“Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you, nor\nI, nor anybody, can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.”",
      "It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood\nperfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,\ntherefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make\nit known to her. He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly\nreplied,--\n\n“Just as you please.”\n\n“May we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?”\n\n“Take whatever you like, and get away.”\n\nElizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went upstairs\ntogether. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication\nwould, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,\nthe letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As\nsoon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being soon married,\nher joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its\nexuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she\nhad ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter\nwould be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her\nfelicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.",
      "“My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried: “this is delightful indeed! She will\nbe married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen! My\ngood, kind brother! I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage\neverything. How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the\nclothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about\nthem directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how\nmuch he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,\nKitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear\nLydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!”\n\nHer eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of\nthese transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.\nGardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.\n\n“For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a great\nmeasure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to\nassist Mr. Wickham with money.”",
      "“Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but\nher own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children\nmust have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have\never had anything from him except a few presents. Well! I am so happy.\nIn a short time, I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well\nit sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in\nsuch a flutter, that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate, and you\nwrite for me. We will settle with your father about the money\nafterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”\n\nShe was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and\ncambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had\nnot Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her\nfather was at leisure to be consulted. One day’s delay, she observed,\nwould be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite\nso obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.",
      "“I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and tell the\ngood, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on\nLady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An\nairing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do\nanything for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill. My dear Hill, have you\nheard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall\nall have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”\n\nMrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her\ncongratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took\nrefuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom. Poor Lydia’s\nsituation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she\nhad need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in looking forward,\nneither rational happiness, nor worldly prosperity could be justly\nexpected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only\ntwo hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“The spiteful old ladies”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,\ninstead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for\nthe better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived\nhim. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that\nrespect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of\nhonour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of\nprevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to\nbe her husband might then have rested in its proper place.\n\nHe was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone\nshould be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law; and he\nwas determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,\nand to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.",
      "When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly\nuseless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join\nin cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow\nand younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters\nsuccessively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.\nBennet, for many years after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he\nwould. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too\nlate to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy; and her\nhusband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their\nincome.",
      "Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and\nthe children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the\nlatter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with\nregard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet\ncould have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In\nterms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though\nexpressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\napprobation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\nengagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed\nthat, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be\ndone with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present\narrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the\nhundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket\nallowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her\nthrough her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expenses had been very little within\nthat sum.",
      "That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was\nanother very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present was to have\nas little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports\nof rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he\nnaturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon\ndespatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in\nits execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was\nindebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia to send any\nmessage to her.\n\nThe good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate\nspeed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent\nphilosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of\nconversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the\nhappiest alternative, been secluded from the world in some distant\nfarm-house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the\ngood-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before from\nall the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit\nin this change of circumstances, because with such a husband her misery\nwas considered certain.",
      "It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on this\nhappy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in\nspirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her\ntriumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of\nher wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of\naccomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those\nattendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and\nservants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a\nproper situation for her daughter; and, without knowing or considering\nwhat their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and\nimportance.\n\n“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings would quit it, or the\ngreat house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is\ntoo far off. I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for\nPurvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”\n\nHer husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the\nservants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, “Mrs.\nBennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and\ndaughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this\nneighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the\nimprudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”",
      "A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it\nsoon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,\nthat her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his\ndaughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of\naffection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend\nit. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\nresentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her\nmarriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe\npossible. She was more alive to the disgrace, which her want of new\nclothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of\nshame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they\ntook place.\n\nElizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of\nthe moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for\nher sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper\ntermination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its\nunfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the\nspot.",
      "She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There were\nfew people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;\nbut at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister’s\nfrailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of\ndisadvantage from it individually to herself; for at any rate there\nseemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia’s marriage been\nconcluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that\nMr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other\nobjection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest\nkind with the man whom he so justly scorned.\n\nFrom such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. The\nwish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his\nfeeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a\nblow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she\nhardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no\nlonger hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there\nseemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that\nshe could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they\nshould meet.",
      "What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the\nproposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now\nhave been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she\ndoubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal,\nthere must be a triumph.\n\nShe began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in\ndisposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and\ntemper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It\nwas an union that must have been to the advantage of both: by her ease\nand liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;\nand from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must\nhave received benefit of greater importance.\n\nBut no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what\nconnubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and\nprecluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their\nfamily.\n\nHow Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she\ncould not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to\na couple who were only brought together because their passions were\nstronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.",
      "Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet’s\nacknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to\npromote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties\nthat the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal\npurport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved\non quitting the militia.",
      "“It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as his\nmarriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in\nconsidering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his\naccount and my niece’s. It is Mr. Wickham’s intention to go into the\nRegulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are\nable and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an\nensigncy in General----’s regiment, now quartered in the north. It is\nan advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He\npromises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each\nhave a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have\nwritten to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,\nand to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham\nin and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have\npledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying\nsimilar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin\na list, according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I\nhope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and\nall will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,\nunless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.\nGardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she\nleaves the south. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to\nyou and her mother.--Yours, etc.",
      "“E. GARDINER.”\n\nMr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham’s\nremoval from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But\nMrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia’s being settled in\nthe north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her\ncompany, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in\nHertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a\npity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted\nwith everybody, and had so many favourites.\n\n“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking\nto send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she\nlikes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General----’s\nregiment.”",
      "His daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being\nadmitted into her family again, before she set off for the north,\nreceived at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who\nagreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and\nconsequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,\nurged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her\nand her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was\nprevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their\nmother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to show\nher married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to\nthe north. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he\nsent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that, as soon\nas the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth\nwas surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme;\nand, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him\nwould have been the last object of her wishes.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“With an affectionate smile”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "Their sister’s wedding-day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her\nprobably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet\nthem at----, and they were to return in it by dinnertime. Their arrival\nwas dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets--and Jane more especially, who\ngave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_\nbeen the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister\nmust endure.\n\nThey came. The family were assembled in the breakfast-room to receive\nthem. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet, as the carriage drove up to\nthe door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,\nanxious, uneasy.\n\nLydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and\nshe ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and\nwelcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to\nWickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy, with an\nalacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness.\n\nTheir reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite\nso cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely\nopened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was\nenough to provoke him.",
      "Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was\nLydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned\nfrom sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at\nlength they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of\nsome little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a\ngreat while since she had been there.\n\nWickham was not at all more distressed than herself; but his manners\nwere always so pleasing, that, had his character and his marriage been\nexactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he\nclaimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth\nhad not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat\ndown, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the\nimpudence of an impudent man. _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the\ncheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of\ncolour.",
      "There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither\nof them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near\nElizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,\nwith a good-humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her\nreplies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the\nworld. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led\nvoluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for\nthe world.\n\n“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away:\nit seems but a fortnight, I declare; and yet there have been things\nenough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure\nI had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I\nthought it would be very good fun if I was.”\n\nHer father lifted up his eyes, Jane was distressed, Elizabeth looked\nexpressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of\nwhich she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,--\n\n“Oh, mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was\nafraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle,\nso I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass\nnext to him, and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the\nwindow frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and\nsmiled like anything.”",
      "Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up and ran out of the room;\nand returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to\nthe dining-parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with\nanxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right hand, and hear her say to\nher eldest sister,--\n\n“Ah, Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a\nmarried woman.”\n\nIt was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment\nfrom which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good\nspirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all\ntheir other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham” by\neach of them; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring\nand boast of being married to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\n\n“Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the\nbreakfast-room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a\ncharming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they\nmay have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the\nplace to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go!”\n\n“Very true; and if I had my will we should. But, my dear Lydia, I don’t\nat all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”",
      "“Oh, Lord! yes; there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things.\nYou and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at\nNewcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I\nwill take care to get good partners for them all.”\n\n“I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.\n\n“And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters\nbehind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the\nwinter is over.”\n\n“I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not\nparticularly like your way of getting husbands.”\n\nTheir visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham\nhad received his commission before he left London, and he was to join\nhis regiment at the end of a fortnight.\n\nNo one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and\nshe made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and\nhaving very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to\nall; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did\nthink than such as did not.",
      "Wickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to\nfind it; not equal to Lydia’s for him. She had scarcely needed her\npresent observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that\ntheir elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather\nthan by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring\nfor her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain\nthat his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and\nif that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity\nof having a companion.\n\nLydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every\noccasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did\neverything best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds\non the first of September than anybody else in the country.\n\nOne morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two\nelder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,--\n\n“Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You were\nnot by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Are not you\ncurious to hear how it was managed?”\n\n“No, really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little\nsaid on the subject.”",
      "“La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were\nmarried, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings were in\nthat parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven\no’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others\nwere to meet us at the church.\n\n“Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,\nyou know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should\nhave gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was\ndressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a\nsermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was\nthinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether\nhe would be married in his blue coat.\n\n“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual: I thought it would never\nbe over; for, by the bye, you are to understand that my uncle and aunt\nwere horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you’ll believe\nme, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a\nfortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything! To be sure, London was\nrather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.",
      "“Well, and so, just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was\ncalled away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you\nknow, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so\nfrightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away;\nand if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day. But,\nluckily, he came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all set\nout. However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented\ngoing, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as\nwell.”\n\n“Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\n\n“Oh, yes! he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But, gracious me!\nI quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised\nthem so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”\n\n“If it was to be a secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the\nsubject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”\n\n“Oh, certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will\nask you no questions.”\n\n“Thank you,” said Lydia; “for if you did, I should certainly tell you\nall, and then Wickham would be so angry.”\n\nOn such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her\npower, by running away.",
      "But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it\nwas impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her\nsister’s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,\nwhere he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.\nConjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her\nbrain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as\nplacing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She\ncould not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,\nwrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\nLydia had dropped, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been\nintended.\n\n“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be to\nknow how a person unconnected with any of us, and, comparatively\nspeaking, a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such\na time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,\nfor very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to\nthink necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with\nignorance.”\n\n“Not that I _shall_, though,” she added to herself, and she finished the\nletter; “and, my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable\nmanner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it\nout.”",
      "Jane’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to\nElizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of\nit:--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any\nsatisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“I am sure she did not listen.”\n]\n\nCHAPTER LII.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as\nsoon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it, than\nhurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be\ninterrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be\nhappy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not\ncontain a denial.\n\n/* RIGHT “Gracechurch Street, _Sept. 6_. */\n\n“My dear Niece,",
      "“I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole\n     morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will\n     not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself\n     surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.\n     Don’t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,\n     that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _your_\n     side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my\n     impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am; and nothing\n     but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed\n     him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and\n     ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming\n     home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr.\n     Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all\n     over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked\n     as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he\n     had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he\n     had seen and talked with them both--Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.\n     From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after\n     ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for\n     them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to\n     himself that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as\n     to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or\n     confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken\n     pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to\n     lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to\n     speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step\n     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on\n     by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never\n     disgrace him. He had been some days in town before he was able to\n     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was\n     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another\n     reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a\n     Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was\n     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though\n     he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward Street,\n     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.\n     Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he\n     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But\n     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he\n     wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery\n     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be\n     found. Wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in\n     London; and had she been able to receive them into her house, they\n     would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our\n     kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----\n     Street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.\n     His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade\n     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her\n     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,\n     offering his assistance as far as it would go. But he found Lydia\n     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none\n     of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of\n     leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or\n     other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her\n     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a\n     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he\n     easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself\n     obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour\n     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill\n     consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to\n     resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation,\n     he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but\n     he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live\n     on. Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once.\n     Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have\n     been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been\n     benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question,\n     that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making\n     his fortune by marriage, in some other country. Under such\n     circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the\n     temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there\n     was much to be discussed. Wickham, of course, wanted more than he\n     could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. Everything\n     being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to make\n     your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch\n     Street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not\n     be seen; and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father\n     was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did\n     not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly\n     consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him\n     till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name,\n     and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called\n     on business. On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your\n     uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk\n     together. They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It\n     was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express\n     was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I\n     fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,\n     after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times;\n     but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not\n     do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked,\n     therefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have\n     settled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which\n     was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it\n     deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead\n     of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up\n     with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely\n     against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning\n     gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that\n     would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where\n     it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no further than yourself, or\n     Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done\n     for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I\n     believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another\n     thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his\n     commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him\n     alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his\n     reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham’s character\n     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been\n     received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in\n     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody’s_\n     reserve can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this\n     fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that\n     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit\n     for _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved\n     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at\n     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more\n     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to\n     receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you everything.\n     It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I\n     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to\n     us, and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was\n     exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I\n     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour\n     while she stayed with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane’s letter\n     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a\n     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no\n     fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,\n     representing to her the wickedness of what she had done, and all\n     the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it\n     was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes\n     quite provoked; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane,\n     and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was punctual\n     in his return, and, as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He\n     dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on\n     Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear\n     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold\n     enough to say before) how much I like him? His behaviour to us has,\n     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.\n     His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but\n     a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his\n     wife may teach him. I thought him very sly; he hardly ever\n     mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive\n     me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so\n     far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I\n     have been all round the park. A low phaeton with a nice little pair\n     of ponies would be the very thing. But I must write no more. The\n     children have been wanting me this half hour.",
      "“Yours, very sincerely,\n\n“M. GARDINER.”",
      "The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,\nin which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the\ngreatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had\nproduced, of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her\nsister’s match--which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of\ngoodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be\njust, from the pain of obligation--were proved beyond their greatest\nextent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken\non himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a\nresearch; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he\nmust abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently\nmeet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe the man whom he always\nmost wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to\npronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard\nnor esteem. Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it\nwas a hope shortly checked by other considerations; and she soon felt\nthat even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his\naffection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to\novercome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with\nWickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from\nthe connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think\nhow much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no\nextraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel\nhe had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising\nit; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,\nshe could perhaps believe, that remaining partiality for her might\nassist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be\nmaterially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that\nthey were under obligations to a person who could never receive a\nreturn. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, everything to\nhim. Oh, how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she\nhad ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards\nhim! For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him,--proud that\nin a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better\nof himself. She read over her aunt’s commendation of him again and\nagain. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible\nof some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly\nboth she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence\nsubsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.",
      "She was roused from her seat and her reflections, by someone’s approach;\nand, before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by\nWickham.\n\n“I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he,\nas he joined her.\n\n“You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not follow\nthat the interruption must be unwelcome.”\n\n“I should be sorry, indeed, if it were. _We_ were always good friends,\nand now we are better.”\n\n“True. Are the others coming out?”\n\n“I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to\nMeryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that\nyou have actually seen Pemberley.”\n\nShe replied in the affirmative.\n\n“I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much\nfor me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the\nold housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of\nme. But of course she did not mention my name to you.”\n\n“Yes, she did.”\n\n“And what did she say?”\n\n“That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned\nout well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely\nmisrepresented.”\n\n“Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had\nsilenced him; but he soon afterwards said,--",
      "“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other\nseveral times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”\n\n“Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said\nElizabeth. “It must be something particular to take him there at this\ntime of year.”\n\n“Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I\nunderstood from the Gardiners that you had.”\n\n“Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”\n\n“And do you like her?”\n\n“Very much.”\n\n“I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year\nor two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad\nyou liked her. I hope she will turn out well.”\n\n“I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”\n\n“Did you go by the village of Kympton?”\n\n“I do not recollect that we did.”\n\n“I mention it because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most\ndelightful place! Excellent parsonage-house! It would have suited me in\nevery respect.”\n\n“How should you have liked making sermons?”\n\n“Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and\nthe exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine; but,\nto be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the\nretirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of\nhappiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the\ncircumstance when you were in Kent?”",
      "“I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was\nleft you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”\n\n“You have! Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the\nfirst, you may remember.”\n\n“I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time when sermon-making was not so\npalatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually\ndeclared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business\nhad been compromised accordingly.”\n\n“You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember\nwhat I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”\n\nThey were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast\nto get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to provoke him,\nshe only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,--\n\n“Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us\nquarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one\nmind.”\n\nShe held out her hand: he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though\nhe hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“Mr. Darcy with him.”\n]\n\nCHAPTER LIII.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he\nnever again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,\nby introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she\nhad said enough to keep him quiet.\n\nThe day of his and Lydia’s departure soon came; and Mrs. Bennet was\nforced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means\nentered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to\ncontinue at least a twelvemonth.\n\n“Oh, my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”\n\n“Oh, Lord! I don’t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”\n\n“Write to me very often, my dear.”\n\n“As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for\nwriting. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to\ndo.”\n\nMr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s. He\nsmiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.\n\n“He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of\nthe house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us\nall. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas\nhimself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”\n\nThe loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.\n\n“I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with\none’s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”",
      "“This is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying a daughter,” said\nElizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other four are\nsingle.”\n\n“It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married;\nbut only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. If\nthat had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”\n\nBut the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly\nrelieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an\narticle of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper\nat Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her\nmaster, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several\nweeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and\nsmiled, and shook her head, by turns.\n\n“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs.\nPhilips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better. Not that\nI care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I\nnever want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to\nNetherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that\nis nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention\na word about it. And so, it is quite certain he is coming?”",
      "“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nichols was in\nMeryton last night: I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose\nto know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certainly true. He\ncomes down on Thursday, at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was\ngoing to the butcher’s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on\nWednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”\n\nMiss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing\ncolour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to\nElizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,--\n\n“I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present\nreport; and I know I appeared distressed; but don’t imagine it was from\nany silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that\nI _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect\nme either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes\nalone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of\n_myself_, but I dread other people’s remarks.”",
      "Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in\nDerbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no\nother view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial\nto Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming\nthere _with_ his friend’s permission, or being bold enough to come\nwithout it.\n\n“Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot come\nto a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this\nspeculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.”\n\nIn spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her\nfeelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily\nperceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,\nmore unequal, than she had often seen them.\n\nThe subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,\nabout a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.\n\n“As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you\nwill wait on him, of course.”\n\n“No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I\nwent to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in\nnothing, and I will not be sent on a fool’s errand again.”\n\nHis wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention\nwould be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to\nNetherfield.",
      "“’Tis an _etiquette_ I despise,” said he. “If he wants our society, let\nhim seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend _my_ hours in\nrunning after my neighbours every time they go away and come back\nagain.”\n\n“Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait\non him. But, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him to dine here, I\nam determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will\nmake thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for\nhim.”\n\nConsoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her\nhusband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her\nneighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before\n_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--\n\n“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It\nwould be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference; but I can\nhardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;\nbut she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she\nsays. Happy shall I be when his stay at Netherfield is over!”\n\n“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it\nis wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction\nof preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have\nalways so much.”",
      "Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,\ncontrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety\nand fretfulness on her side be as long as it could. She counted the days\nthat must intervene before their invitation could be sent--hopeless of\nseeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in\nHertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the\npaddock, and ride towards the house.\n\nHer daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely\nkept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went\nto the window--she looked--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down\nagain by her sister.\n\n“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”\n\n“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not\nknow.”\n\n“La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with\nhim before. Mr. what’s his name--that tall, proud man.”\n\n“Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of\nMr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must\nsay that I hate the very sight of him.”",
      "Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little\nof their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness\nwhich must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time\nafter receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable\nenough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their\nmother talked on of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be\ncivil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by either\nof them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be\nsuspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs.\nGardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards\nhim. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,\nand whose merits she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\ninformation, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted\nfor the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an\ninterest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as\nwhat Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his\ncoming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,\nwas almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered\nbehaviour in Derbyshire.",
      "The colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a\nminute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to\nher eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and\nwishes must still be unshaken; but she would not be secure.\n\n“Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early\nenough for expectation.”\n\nShe sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to\nlift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her\nsister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little\npaler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the\ngentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with\ntolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any\nsymptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.\n\nElizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down\nagain to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She\nhad ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and,\nshe thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as\nshe had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps, he could not in her\nmother’s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a\npainful, but not an improbable, conjecture.",
      "Bingley she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period\nsaw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.\nBennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,\nespecially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of\nher courtesy and address of his friend.\n\nElizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the\npreservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was\nhurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill\napplied.\n\nDarcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did--a question\nwhich she could not answer without confusion--said scarcely anything. He\nwas not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but\nit had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends\nwhen he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed, without\nbringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist\nthe impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often\nfound him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but\nthe ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when\nthey last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry\nwith herself for being so.\n\n“Could I expect it to be otherwise?” said she. “Yet why did he come?”",
      "She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to\nhim she had hardly courage to speak.\n\nShe inquired after his sister, but could do no more.\n\n“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.\n\nHe readily agreed to it.\n\n“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say,\nyou meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope\nit is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood\nsince you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled: and one of my\nown daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have\nseen it in the papers. It was in the ‘Times’ and the ‘Courier,’ I know;\nthough it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately,\nGeorge Wickham, Esq., to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a\nsyllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.\nIt was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up, too, and I wonder how he came\nto make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”\n\nBingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth\ndared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could\nnot tell.",
      "“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,”\ncontinued her mother; “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very\nhard to have her taken away from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a\nplace quite northward it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not\nknow how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of\nhis leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the Regulars.\nThank heaven! he has _some_ friends, though, perhaps, not so many as he\ndeserves.”\n\nElizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery\nof shame that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however,\nthe exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done\nbefore; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the\ncountry at present. A few weeks, he believed.\n\n“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother,\n“I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr.\nBennet’s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and\nwill save all the best of the coveys for you.”",
      "Elizabeth’s misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious\nattention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had\nflattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be\nhastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,\nthat years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for\nmoments of such painful confusion.\n\n“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to be\nin company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure\nthat will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either\none or the other again!”\n\nYet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no\ncompensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing\nhow much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former\nlover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little, but every\nfive minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her\nas handsome as she had been last year; as good-natured, and as\nunaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no\ndifference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded\nthat she talked as much as ever; but her mind was so busily engaged,\nthat she did not always know when she was silent.",
      "When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her\nintended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at\nLongbourn in a few days’ time.\n\n“You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added; “for when\nyou went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with\nus as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you\nI was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your\nengagement.”\n\nBingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of\nhis concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.\n\nMrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine\nthere that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did\nnot think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man\non whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride\nof one who had ten thousand a year.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“Jane happened to look round”\n]\n\nCHAPTER LIV.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAs soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;\nor, in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects\nwhich must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed\nher.\n\n“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she,\n“did he come at all?”\n\nShe could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.",
      "“He could be still amiable, still pleasing to my uncle and aunt, when he\nwas in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he\nno longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing man! I will think\nno more about him.”\n\nHer resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach\nof her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her\nbetter satisfied with their visitors than Elizabeth.\n\n“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly\neasy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by\nhis coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly\nseen, that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent\nacquaintance.”\n\n“Yes, very indifferent, indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “Oh, Jane!\ntake care.”\n\n“My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.”\n\n“I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with\nyou as ever.”\n\nThey did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in\nthe meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes which the\ngood-humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s visit,\nhad revived.",
      "On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two\nwho were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as\nsportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the\ndining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take\nthe place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by\nher sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to\ninvite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to\nhesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was\ndecided. He placed himself by her.\n\nElizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He\nbore it with noble indifference; and she would have imagined that\nBingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes\nlikewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing\nalarm.",
      "His behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an\nadmiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded\nElizabeth, that, if left wholly to himself, Jane’s happiness, and his\nown, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the\nconsequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It\ngave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\nno cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table\ncould divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little\nsuch a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to\nadvantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but\nshe could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and\ncold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousness\nmade the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind;\nand she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell\nhim, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of\nthe family.",
      "She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of\nbringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away\nwithout enabling them to enter into something more of conversation,\nthan the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and\nuneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen\ncame, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.\nShe looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her\nchance of pleasure for the evening must depend.\n\n“If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him up for\never.”\n\nThe gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have\nanswered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,\nwhere Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,\nin so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her\nwhich would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of\nthe girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,--\n\n“The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;\ndo we?”\n\nDarcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with\nher eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough\nto help anybody to coffee, and then was enraged against herself for\nbeing so silly!",
      "“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to\nexpect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex who would not\nprotest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?\nThere is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.”\n\nShe was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee-cup\nhimself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,--\n\n“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”\n\n“Yes; she will remain there till Christmas.”\n\n“And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?”\n\n“Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough\nthese three weeks.”\n\nShe could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse\nwith her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for\nsome minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering\nto Elizabeth again, he walked away.",
      "When the tea things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies\nall rose; and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when\nall her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her\nmother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated\nwith the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.\nThey were confined for the evening at different tables; and she had\nnothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side\nof the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\n\nMrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to\nsupper; but their carriage was, unluckily, ordered before any of the\nothers, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.",
      "“Well, girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “what\nsay you to the day? I think everything has passed off uncommonly well, I\nassure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The\nvenison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat\na haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the\nLucases’ last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges\nwere remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French\ncooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater\nbeauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And\nwhat do you think she said besides? ‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her\nat Netherfield at last!’ She did, indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as\ngood a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved\ngirls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“M^{rs}. Long and her nieces.”\n]\n\nMrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits: she had seen enough of\nBingley’s behaviour to Jane to be convinced that she would get him at\nlast; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy\nhumour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at\nnot seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.",
      "“It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. “The\nparty seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we\nmay often meet again.”\n\nElizabeth smiled.\n\n“Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I\nassure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an\nagreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it. I am\nperfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had\nany design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with\ngreater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally\npleasing, than any other man.”\n\n“You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me smile, and\nare provoking me to it every moment.”\n\n“How hard it is in some cases to be believed! And how impossible in\nothers! But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\nacknowledge?”\n\n“That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to\ninstruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive\nme; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your\nconfidante.”\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak to you.”\n]\n\nCHAPTER LV.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His\nfriend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in\nten days’ time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably\ngood spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many\nexpressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.\n\n“Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”\n\nHe should be particularly happy at any time, etc., etc.; and if she\nwould give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on\nthem.\n\n“Can you come to-morrow?”\n\nYes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was\naccepted with alacrity.\n\nHe came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them\ndressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughters’ room, in her\ndressing-gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,--\n\n“My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is\ncome. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss\nBennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss\nLizzy’s hair.”\n\n“We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is\nforwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs half an hour ago.”\n\n“Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come, be quick, be quick!\nwhere is your sash, my dear?”",
      "But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down\nwithout one of her sisters.\n\nThe same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the\nevening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his\ncustom, and Mary went upstairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the\nfive being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at\nElizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any\nimpression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last\nKitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter, mamma? What do\nyou keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”\n\n“Nothing, child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat still\nfive minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she\nsuddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,--\n\n“Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,” took her out of the room.\nJane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such\npremeditation, and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a\nfew minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,--\n\n“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”\n\nElizabeth was forced to go.\n\n“We may as well leave them by themselves, you know,” said her mother as\nsoon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in\nmy dressing-room.”",
      "Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained\nquietly in the hall till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned\ninto the drawing-room.\n\nMrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was\neverything that was charming, except the professed lover of her\ndaughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable\naddition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged\nofficiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a\nforbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the\ndaughter.\n\nHe scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away\nan engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet’s\nmeans, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.\n\nAfter this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed\nbetween the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the\nhappy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy\nreturned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably\npersuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman’s\nconcurrence.",
      "Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the\nmorning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more\nagreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption\nor folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into\nsilence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the\nother had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;\nand in the evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get\neverybody away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to\nwrite, went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after tea; for\nas the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be\nwanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.",
      "But on her returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished,\nshe saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her\nmother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she\nperceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as\nif engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion,\nthe faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each\nother, would have told it all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but\n_hers_ she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by\neither; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when\nBingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and,\nwhispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.\n\nJane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give\npleasure; and, instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest\nemotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.\n\n“’Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh,\nwhy is not everybody as happy?”\n\nElizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a\ndelight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of\nkindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not\nallow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be\nsaid, for the present.",
      "“I must go instantly to my mother,” she cried. “I would not on any\naccount trifle with her affectionate solicitude, or allow her to hear it\nfrom anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh, Lizzy, to\nknow that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear\nfamily! how shall I bear so much happiness?”\n\nShe then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the\ncard-party, and was sitting upstairs with Kitty.\n\nElizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease\nwith which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many\nprevious months of suspense and vexation.\n\n“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious\ncircumspection! of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance! the\nhappiest, wisest, and most reasonable end!”\n\nIn a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her\nfather had been short and to the purpose.\n\n“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.\n\n“With my mother upstairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”",
      "He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes\nand affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her\ndelight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with\ngreat cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen\nto all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane’s perfections;\nand in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his\nexpectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for\nbasis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition of\nJane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and\nhimself.\n\nIt was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of\nMiss Bennet’s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face, as\nmade her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped\nher turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or\nspeak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,\nthough she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when\nMr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed\nhow really happy he was.\n\nNot a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their\nvisitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he\nturned to his daughter and said,--\n\n“Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”",
      "Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\ngoodness.\n\n“You are a good girl,” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in\nthinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your\ndoing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are\neach of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so\neasy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will\nalways exceed your income.”\n\n“I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be\nunpardonable in _me_.”\n\n“Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you\ntalking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely\nmore.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh, my dear, dear Jane, I am so\nhappy! I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it\nwould be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not\nbe so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when\nhe first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was\nthat you should come together. Oh, he is the handsomest young man that\never was seen!”\n\nWickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her\nfavourite child. At that moment she cared for no other. Her younger\nsisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness\nwhich she might in future be able to dispense.",
      "Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty\nbegged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\n\nBingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;\ncoming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after\nsupper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough\ndetested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought\nhimself obliged to accept.\n\nElizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for\nwhile he was present Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else: but\nshe found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of\nseparation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always\nattached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; and\nwhen Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.\n\n“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he\nwas totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed\nit possible.”\n\n“I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account for\nit?”",
      "“It must have been his sisters’ doing. They were certainly no friends to\nhis acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have\nchosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,\nas I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will\nlearn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again: though we\ncan never be what we once were to each other.”\n\n“That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever\nheard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again\nthe dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”\n\n“Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November he\nreally loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent\nwould have prevented his coming down again?”\n\n“He made a little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of his\nmodesty.”\n\nThis naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and\nthe little value he put on his own good qualities.\n\nElizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference\nof his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving\nheart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice\nher against him.",
      "“I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried\nJane. “Oh, Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed\nabove them all? If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such\nanother man for you!”\n\n“If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you.\nTill I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your\nhappiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very\ngood luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”\n\nThe situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a\nsecret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and\nshe ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her\nneighbours in Meryton.\n\nThe Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the\nworld; though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,\nthey had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane had been\nformed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the\ndining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the\nsound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the\nlawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides, the\nequipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses\nwere post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who\npreceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that\nsomebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid\nthe confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the\nshrubbery. They both set off; and the conjectures of the remaining three\ncontinued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown\nopen, and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\n\nThey were of course all intending to be surprised: but their\nastonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.\nBennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even\ninferior to what Elizabeth felt.",
      "She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no\nother reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight inclination of the\nhead, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her\nname to her mother on her Ladyship’s entrance, though no request of\nintroduction had been made.\n\nMrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such\nhigh importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting\nfor a moment in silence, she said, very stiffly, to Elizabeth,--\n\n“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your\nmother?”\n\nElizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\n\n“And _that_, I suppose, is one of your sisters?”\n\n“Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady Catherine.\n“She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,\nand my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with a young man,\nwho, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.”\n\n“You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine, after a\nshort silence.\n\n“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my Lady, I dare say; but, I\nassure you, it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”\n\n“This must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening in\nsummer: the windows are full west.”\n\nMrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then\nadded,--",
      "“May I take the liberty of asking your Ladyship whether you left Mr. and\nMrs. Collins well?”\n\n“Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.”\n\nElizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from\nCharlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no\nletter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.\n\nMrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her Ladyship to take some\nrefreshment: but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,\ndeclined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,--\n\n“Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness\non one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you\nwill favour me with your company.”\n\n“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her Ladyship about the\ndifferent walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”\n\nElizabeth obeyed; and, running into her own room for her parasol,\nattended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall,\nLady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and\ndrawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be\ndecent-looking rooms, walked on.",
      "Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\nwaiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk\nthat led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for\nconversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and\ndisagreeable.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“After a short survey”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in\nher face.\n\nAs soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following\nmanner:--\n\n“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my\njourney hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I\ncome.”\n\nElizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\n\n“Indeed, you are mistaken, madam; I have not been at all able to account\nfor the honour of seeing you here.”",
      "“Miss Bennet,” replied her Ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to\nknow that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may\nchoose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been\ncelebrated for its sincerity and frankness; and in a cause of such\nmoment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most\nalarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only your\nsister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that\n_you_--that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would, in all likelihood, be soon\nafterwards united to my nephew--my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I\n_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him\nso much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on\nsetting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to\nyou.”\n\n“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring\nwith astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming\nso far. What could your Ladyship propose by it?”\n\n“At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”\n\n“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabeth\ncoolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it--if, indeed, such a report\nis in existence.”",
      "“If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been\nindustriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a\nreport is spread abroad?”\n\n“I never heard that it was.”\n\n“And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?”\n\n“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship. _You_\nmay ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer.”\n\n“This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has\nhe, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”\n\n“Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”\n\n“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his\nreason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,\nhave made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You\nmay have drawn him in.”\n\n“If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”\n\n“Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such\nlanguage as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,\nand am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”\n\n“But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as\nthis ever induce me to be explicit.”\n\n“Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the\npresumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is\nengaged to _my daughter_. Now, what have you to say?”",
      "“Only this,--that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will\nmake an offer to me.”\n\nLady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,--\n\n“The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,\nthey have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of\n_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles we planned the\nunion; and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be\naccomplished, is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of\ninferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to\nthe family? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends--to his\ntacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of\npropriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his\nearliest hours he was destined for his cousin?”\n\n“Yes; and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no\nother objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be\nkept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry\nMiss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the\nmarriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by\nhonour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make\nanother choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”",
      "“Because honour, decorum, prudence--nay, interest--forbid it. Yes, Miss\nBennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or\nfriends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will\nbe censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.\nYour alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned\nby any of us.”\n\n“These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife of Mr.\nDarcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily\nattached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause\nto repine.”\n\n“Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude\nfor my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that\nscore? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came\nhere with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I\nbe dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person’s\nwhims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”\n\n“_That_ will make your Ladyship’s situation at present more pitiable;\nbut it will have no effect on _me_.”",
      "“I will not be interrupted! Hear me in silence. My daughter and my\nnephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal\nside, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s, from respectable,\nhonourable, and ancient, though untitled, families. Their fortune on\nboth sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of\nevery member of their respective houses; and what is to divide\nthem?--the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family,\nconnections, or fortune! Is this to be endured? But it must not, shall\nnot be! If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to\nquit the sphere in which you have been brought up.”\n\n“In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that\nsphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s daughter; so far we are\nequal.”\n\n“True. You _are_ a gentleman’s daughter. But what was your mother? Who\nare your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their\ncondition.”\n\n“Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew does\nnot object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.”\n\n“Tell me, once for all, are you engaged to him?”\n\nThough Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady\nCatherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a\nmoment’s deliberation,--\n\n“I am not.”\n\nLady Catherine seemed pleased.",
      "“And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement?”\n\n“I will make no promise of the kind.”\n\n“Miss Bennet, I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more\nreasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I\nwill ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the\nassurance I require.”\n\n“And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into\nanything so wholly unreasonable. Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry\nyour daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make\n_their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to\nme, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on\nhis cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with\nwhich you have supported this extraordinary application have been as\nfrivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my\ncharacter, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.\nHow far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,\nI cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in\nmine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no further on the\nsubject.”",
      "“Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the\nobjections I have already urged I have still another to add. I am no\nstranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s infamous\nelopement. I know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was a\npatched-up business, at the expense of your father and uncle. And is\n_such_ a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is _her_ husband, who is the son\nof his late father’s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of\nwhat are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”\n\n“You can _now_ have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered.\n“You have insulted me, in every possible method. I must beg to return to\nthe house.”\n\nAnd she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned\nback. Her Ladyship was highly incensed.\n\n“You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!\nUnfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you\nmust disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”\n\n“Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.”\n\n“You are then resolved to have him?”\n\n“I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,\nwhich will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without\nreference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”",
      "“It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the\nclaims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in\nthe opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.”\n\n“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “has any\npossible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either\nwould be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the\nresentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former\n_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s\nconcern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in\nthe scorn.”\n\n“And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I\nshall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your\nambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you\nreasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point.”\n\nIn this manner Lady Catherine talked on till they were at the door of\nthe carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,--\n\n“I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your\nmother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.”",
      "Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her\nLadyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She\nheard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs. Her mother\nimpatiently met her at the door of her dressing-room, to ask why Lady\nCatherine would not come in again and rest herself.\n\n“She did not choose it,” said her daughter; “she would go.”\n\n“She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously\ncivil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.\nShe is on her road somewhere, I dare say; and so, passing through\nMeryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had\nnothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?”\n\nElizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here; for to\nacknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“But now it comes out”\n]\n\nCHAPTER LVII.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw\nElizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many\nhours learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it\nappeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings\nfor the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.\nDarcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of\ntheir engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;\ntill she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,\nand _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the\nexpectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply\nthe idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her\nsister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at\nLucas Lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the\nCollinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine,) had\nonly set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate which _she_ had\nlooked forward to as possible at some future time.",
      "In revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not help\nfeeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting\nin this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to\nprevent the marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an\napplication to her nephew; and how he might take a similar\nrepresentation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared\nnot pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his\naunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\nthat he thought much higher of her Ladyship than _she_ could do; and it\nwas certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_\nwhose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would\naddress him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would\nprobably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak\nand ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.\n\nIf he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often\nseemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might\nsettle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity\nunblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady\nCatherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to\nBingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.",
      "“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his\nfriend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to understand\nit. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his\nconstancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might\nhave obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him\nat all.”\n\nThe surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had\nbeen, was very great: but they obligingly satisfied it with the same\nkind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet’s curiosity; and\nElizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.\n\nThe next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her\nfather, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.\n\n“Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you: come into my room.”\n\nShe followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell\nher was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner\nconnected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might\nbe from Lady Catherine, and she anticipated with dismay all the\nconsequent explanations.\n\nShe followed her father to the fireplace, and they both sat down. He\nthen said,--",
      "“I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me\nexceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its\ncontents. I did not know before that I had _two_ daughters on the brink\nof matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”\n\nThe colour now rushed into Elizabeth’s cheeks in the instantaneous\nconviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;\nand she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained\nhimself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to\nherself, when her father continued,--\n\n“You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters\nas these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity to discover the\nname of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.”\n\n“From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?”",
      "“Something very much to the purpose, of course. He begins with\ncongratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of\nwhich, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping\nLucases. I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says\non that point. What relates to yourself is as follows:--‘Having thus\noffered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on\nthis happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another,\nof which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter\nElizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after\nher eldest sister has resigned it; and the chosen partner of her fate\nmay be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages\nin this land.’ Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?\n‘This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything the\nheart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and\nextensive patronage. Yet, in spite of all these temptations, let me warn\nmy cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a\nprecipitate closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course,\nyou will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.’ Have you any idea,\nLizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out. ‘My motive for\ncautioning you is as follows:--We have reason to imagine that his aunt,\nLady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly\neye.’ _Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_\nsurprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within\nthe circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more\neffectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any\nwoman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in\nhis life! It is admirable!”",
      "Elizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could only force\none most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so\nlittle agreeable to her.\n\n“Are you not diverted?”\n\n“Oh, yes. Pray read on.”",
      "“‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship last\nnight, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she\nfelt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that, on the score of\nsome family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give\nher consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my\nduty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she\nand her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run\nhastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ Mr.\nCollins, moreover, adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia’s sad\nbusiness has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their\nliving together before the marriage took place should be so generally\nknown. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain\nfrom declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young\ncouple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an\nencouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should\nvery strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as\na Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their\nnames to be mentioned in your hearing.’ _That_ is his notion of\nChristian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear\nCharlotte’s situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But,\nLizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be\n_missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For\nwhat do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them\nin our turn?”",
      "“Oh,” cried Elizabeth, “I am exceedingly diverted. But it is so\nstrange!”\n\n“Yes, _that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man\nit would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference and _your_\npointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate\nwriting, I would not give up Mr. Collins’s correspondence for any\nconsideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving\nhim the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and\nhypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine\nabout this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?”\n\nTo this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had\nbeen asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his\nrepeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her\nfeelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh when she\nwould rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her by\nwhat he said of Mr. Darcy’s indifference; and she could do nothing but\nwonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that, perhaps, instead of\nhis seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“The efforts of his aunt”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\nCHAPTER LVIII.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as\nElizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy\nwith him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine’s\nvisit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to\ntell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in\nmomentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed\ntheir all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the\nhabit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five\nset off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to\noutstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy\nwere to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was\ntoo much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a\ndesperate resolution; and, perhaps, he might be doing the same.\n\nThey walked towards the Lucases’, because Kitty wished to call upon\nMaria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,\nwhen Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the\nmoment for her resolution to be executed; and while her courage was\nhigh, she immediately said,--",
      "“Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature, and for the sake of giving\nrelief to my own feelings care not how much I may be wounding yours. I\ncan no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor\nsister. Ever since I have known it I have been most anxious to\nacknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest\nof my family I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.”\n\n“I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise\nand emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a\nmistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner\nwas so little to be trusted.”\n\n“You must not blame my aunt. Lydia’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to\nme that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could\nnot rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,\nin the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced\nyou to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the\nsake of discovering them.”\n\n“If you _will_ thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself alone.\nThat the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other\ninducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your\n_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought\nonly of _you_.”",
      "Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,\nher companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with me. If your\nfeelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_\naffections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence\nme on this subject for ever.”\n\nElizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of\nhis situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not\nvery fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone\nso material a change since the period to which he alluded, as to make\nher receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The\nhappiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never\nfelt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as\nwarmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth\nbeen able to encounter his eyes, she might have seen how well the\nexpression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him: but\nthough she could not look she could listen; and he told her of feelings\nwhich, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection\nevery moment more valuable.",
      "They walked on without knowing in what direction. There was too much to\nbe thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She\nsoon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding\nto the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through\nLondon, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the\nsubstance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on\nevery expression of the latter, which, in her Ladyship’s apprehension,\npeculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that\nsuch a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from\nher nephew which _she_ had refused to give. But, unluckily for her\nLadyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.\n\n“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed myself\nto hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that\nhad you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have\nacknowledged it to Lady Catherine frankly and openly.”\n\nElizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know enough of\nmy _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so\nabominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all\nyour relations.”",
      "“What did you say of me that I did not deserve? For though your\naccusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour\nto you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was\nunpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”\n\n“We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that\nevening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if strictly\nexamined, will be irreproachable; but since then we have both, I hope,\nimproved in civility.”\n\n“I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I\nthen said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of\nit, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your\nreproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: ‘Had you behaved in a\nmore gentlemanlike manner.’ Those were your words. You know not, you can\nscarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; though it was some time, I\nconfess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”\n\n“I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an\nimpression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such\na way.”\n\n“I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper\nfeeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never\nforget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible\nway that would induce you to accept me.”",
      "“Oh, do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at\nall. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”\n\nDarcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he,--“did it _soon_ make you\nthink better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its\ncontents?”\n\nShe explained what its effects on her had been, and how gradually all\nher former prejudices had been removed.\n\n“I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was\nnecessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part,\nespecially the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power\nof reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly\nmake you hate me.”\n\n“The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the\npreservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my\nopinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily\nchanged as that implies.”\n\n“When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself perfectly\ncalm and cool; but I am since convinced that it was written in a\ndreadful bitterness of spirit.”",
      "“The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The\nadieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings\nof the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely\ndifferent from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance\nattending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my\nphilosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you\npleasure.”",
      "“I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_\nretrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment\narising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of\nignorance. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful recollections will\nintrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been a\nselfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a\nchild I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my\ntemper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride\nand conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only _child_),\nI was spoiled by my parents, who, though good themselves, (my father\nparticularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,\nalmost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond\nmy own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to\n_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with\nmy own. Such I was, from eight to eight-and-twenty; and such I might\nstill have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not\nowe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most\nadvantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a\ndoubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my\npretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.”",
      "“Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”\n\n“Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be\nwishing, expecting my addresses.”\n\n“My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure\nyou. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me\nwrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening!”\n\n“Hate you! I was angry, perhaps, at first, but my anger soon began to\ntake a proper direction.”\n\n“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at\nPemberley. You blamed me for coming?”\n\n“No, indeed, I felt nothing but surprise.”\n\n“Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.\nMy conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I\nconfess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.”\n\n“My object _then_,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility\nin my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped\nto obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you\nsee that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes\nintroduced themselves, I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half\nan hour after I had seen you.”",
      "He then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her\ndisappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to\nthe cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of\nfollowing her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed\nbefore he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there\nhad arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must\ncomprehend.\n\nShe expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to\neach to be dwelt on farther.\n\nAfter walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know\nanything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that\nit was time to be at home.\n\n“What could have become of Mr. Bingley and Jane?” was a wonder which\nintroduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. Darcy was delighted with\ntheir engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of\nit.\n\n“I must ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.\n\n“Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.”\n\n“That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.” And\nthough he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much\nthe case.",
      "“On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a\nconfession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told\nhim of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his\naffairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had\nthe slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself\nmistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent\nto him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was\nunabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.”\n\nElizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his\nfriend.\n\n“Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him\nthat my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”\n\n“From the former. I had narrowly observed her, during the two visits\nwhich I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection.”\n\n“And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to\nhim.”",
      "“It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had\nprevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but\nhis reliance on mine made everything easy. I was obliged to confess one\nthing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not\nallow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months\nlast winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was\nangry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained\nin any doubt of your sister’s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me\nnow.”\n\nElizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful\nfriend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked\nherself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and\nit was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of\nBingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he\ncontinued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they\nparted.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“Unable to utter a syllable”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\nCHAPTER LIX.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "“My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a question\nwhich Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and\nfrom all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in\nreply, that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own\nknowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything\nelse, awakened a suspicion of the truth.\n\nThe evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The\nacknowledged lovers talked and laughed; the unacknowledged were silent.\nDarcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;\nand Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy\nthan _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,\nthere were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in\nthe family when her situation became known: she was aware that no one\nliked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a\n_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.\n\nAt night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far\nfrom Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.\n\n“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be! Engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,\nyou shall not deceive me: I know it to be impossible.”",
      "“This is a wretched beginning, indeed! My sole dependence was on you;\nand I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I\nam in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we\nare engaged.”\n\nJane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much\nyou dislike him.”\n\n“You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I\ndid not always love him so well as I do now; but in such cases as these\na good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever\nremember it myself.”\n\nMiss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more\nseriously, assured her of its truth.\n\n“Good heaven! can it be really so? Yet now I must believe you,” cried\nJane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would, I do congratulate you; but are you\ncertain--forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be\nhappy with him?”\n\n“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already that we\nare to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane?\nShall you like to have such a brother?”\n\n“Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more\ndelight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you\nreally love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than\nmarry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought\nto do?”",
      "“Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do when I\ntell you all.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am\nafraid you will be angry.”\n\n“My dearest sister, now be, _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously.\nLet me know everything that I am to know without delay. Will you tell me\nhow long you have loved him?”\n\n“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began;\nbut I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds\nat Pemberley.”\n\nAnother entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the\ndesired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of\nattachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing\nfurther to wish.\n\n“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself. I\nalways had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I\nmust always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley’s friend and your\nhusband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But,\nLizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you\ntell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know\nof it to another, not to you.”",
      "Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to\nmention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made\nher equally avoid the name of his friend: but now she would no longer\nconceal from her his share in Lydia’s marriage. All was acknowledged,\nand half the night spent in conversation.\n\n“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next\nmorning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with\nour dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always\ncoming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or\nother, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?\nLizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley’s\nway.”\n\nElizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet\nwas really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an\nepithet.\n\nAs soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and\nshook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;\nand he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes\nhereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”\n\n“I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to walk\nto Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has\nnever seen the view.”",
      "“It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am\nsure it will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?”\n\nKitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great\ncuriosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently\nconsented. As she went upstairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her,\nsaying,--\n\n“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that\ndisagreeable man all to yourself; but I hope you will not mind it. It is\nall for Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to\nhim except just now and then; so do not put yourself to inconvenience.”\n\nDuring their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should be\nasked in the course of the evening: Elizabeth reserved to herself the\napplication for her mother’s. She could not determine how her mother\nwould take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur\nwould be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man; but whether she\nwere violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it\nwas certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to\nher sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the\nfirst raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her\ndisapprobation.",
      "In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw\nMr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was\nextreme. She did not fear her father’s opposition, but he was going to\nbe made unhappy, and that it should be through her means; that _she_,\nhis favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be\nfilling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched\nreflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,\nlooking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes\nhe approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while\npretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, “Go to your father; he\nwants you in the library.” She was gone directly.\n\nHer father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.\n“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses to be\naccepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”\n\nHow earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more\nreasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from\nexplanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;\nbut they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,\nof her attachment to Mr. Darcy.",
      "“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be\nsure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.\nBut will they make you happy?”\n\n“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my\nindifference?”\n\n“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but\nthis would be nothing if you really liked him.”\n\n“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes; “I love him.\nIndeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not\nknow what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in\nsuch terms.”\n\n“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the kind\nof man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he\ncondescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on\nhaving him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your\ndisposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor\nrespectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband, unless you looked\nup to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the\ngreatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape\ndiscredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing\n_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are\nabout.”",
      "Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;\nand, at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the\nobject of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her\nestimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that\nhis affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many\nmonths’ suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities,\nshe did conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the\nmatch.\n\n“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to\nsay. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with\nyou, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”\n\nTo complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy\nhad voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.\n\n“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did everything;\nmade up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him\nhis commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble\nand economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and _would_ have\npaid him; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own\nway. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow, he will rant and storm about\nhis love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”",
      "He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading\nMr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her\nat last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come\nfor Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”\n\nElizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after\nhalf an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join\nthe others with tolerable composure. Everything was too recent for\ngaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer\nanything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity\nwould come in time.\n\nWhen her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,\nand made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;\nfor, on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to\nutter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could\ncomprehend what she heard, though not in general backward to credit what\nwas for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a\nlover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in\nher chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.",
      "“Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would\nhave thought it? And is it really true? Oh, my sweetest Lizzy! how rich\nand how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages\nyou will have! Jane’s is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so\npleased--so happy. Such a charming man! so handsome! so tall! Oh, my\ndear Lizzy! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before. I\nhope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Everything\nthat is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,\nLord! what will become of me? I shall go distracted.”\n\nThis was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted; and\nElizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,\nsoon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,\nher mother followed her.\n\n“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else. Ten\nthousand a year, and very likely more! ’Tis as good as a lord! And a\nspecial licence--you must and shall be married by a special licence.\nBut, my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond\nof, that I may have it to-morrow.”",
      "This was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the gentleman\nhimself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain\npossession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations’\nconsent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow\npassed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood\nin such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak\nto him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark\nher deference for his opinion.\n\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get\nacquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising\nevery hour in his esteem.\n\n“I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “Wickham, perhaps,\nis my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well\nas Jane’s.”\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“The obsequious civility.”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\nCHAPTER LX.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nElizabeth’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.\nDarcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “How could\nyou begin?” said she. “I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when\nyou had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first\nplace?”",
      "“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which\nlaid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I\nknew that I _had_ begun.”\n\n“My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour\nto _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke\nto you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now, be\nsincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?”\n\n“For the liveliness of your mind I did.”\n\n“You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.\nThe fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious\nattention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,\nand looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused and\ninterested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really\namiable you would have hated me for it: but in spite of the pains you\ntook to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and\nin your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously\ncourted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;\nand really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly\nreasonable. To be sure you know no actual good of me--but nobody thinks\nof _that_ when they fall in love.”\n\n“Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was\nill at Netherfield?”",
      "“Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it\nby all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are\nto exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me\nto find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may\nbe; and I shall begin directly, by asking you what made you so unwilling\nto come to the point at last? What made you so shy of me, when you\nfirst called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you\ncalled, did you look as if you did not care about me?”\n\n“Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.”\n\n“But I was embarrassed.”\n\n“And so was I.”\n\n“You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”\n\n“A man who had felt less might.”\n\n“How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that\nI should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you\n_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when\nyou _would_ have spoken if I had not asked you! My resolution of\nthanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. _Too\nmuch_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort\nsprings from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the\nsubject? This will never do.”",
      "“You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady\nCatherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of\nremoving all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to\nyour eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to\nwait for an opening of yours. My aunt’s intelligence had given me hope,\nand I was determined at once to know everything.”\n\n“Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,\nfor she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to\nNetherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?\nor had you intended any more serious consequences?”\n\n“My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I\nmight ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to\nmyself, was to see whether your sister was still partial to Bingley, and\nif she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.”\n\n“Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to\nbefall her?”\n\n“I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought to\nbe done; and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done\ndirectly.”\n\n“And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and\nadmire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But\nI have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”",
      "From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy\nhad been overrated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner’s\nlong letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would\nbe most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt\nhad already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as\nfollows:--\n\n“I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,\nfor your long, kind, satisfactory detail of particulars; but, to say the\ntruth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.\nBut _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose to your fancy,\nindulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will\nafford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly\nerr. You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more\nthan you did in your last. I thank you again and again, for not going to\nthe Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the\nponies is delightful. We will go round the park every day. I am the\nhappiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so\nbefore, but no one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she\nonly smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that\ncan be spared from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.\nYours,” etc.",
      "Mr. Darcy’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style, and still\ndifferent from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in return\nfor his last.\n\n/* “Dear Sir, */\n\n“I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will\n     soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as\n     you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has\n     more to give.\n\n“Yours sincerely,” etc.\n\nMiss Bingley’s congratulations to her brother on his approaching\nmarriage were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even to\nJane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former\nprofessions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and\nthough feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much\nkinder answer than she knew was deserved.\n\nThe joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information was\nas sincere as her brother’s in sending it. Four sides of paper were\ninsufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of\nbeing loved by her sister.",
      "Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations\nto Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the\nCollinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this\nsudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so\nexceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew’s letter, that\nCharlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till\nthe storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend\nwas a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their\nmeetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she\nsaw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her\nhusband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even\nlisten to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away\nthe brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all\nmeeting frequently at St. James’s, with very decent composure. If he did\nshrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.",
      "Mrs. Philips’s vulgarity was another, and, perhaps, a greater tax on his\nforbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood in\ntoo much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley’s\ngood-humour encouraged; yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be\nvulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at\nall likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to\nshield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to\nkeep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might\nconverse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings\narising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its\npleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward\nwith delight to the time when they should be removed from society so\nlittle pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their\nfamily party at Pemberley.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER LXI.\n\n[Illustration]",
      "Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got\nrid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she\nafterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be\nguessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the\naccomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of\nher children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,\namiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though, perhaps,\nit was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic\nfelicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous\nand invariably silly.\n\nMr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her\ndrew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in\ngoing to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.\n\nMr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near\na vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to\n_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his\nsisters was then gratified: he bought an estate in a neighbouring county\nto Derbyshire; and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source\nof happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.",
      "Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with\nher two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally\nknown, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a\ntemper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia’s example, she\nbecame, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less\nignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia’s\nsociety she was of course carefully kept; and though Mrs. Wickham\nfrequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of\nballs and young men, her father would never consent to her going.\n\nMary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily\ndrawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet’s being quite\nunable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but\nshe could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no\nlonger mortified by comparisons between her sisters’ beauty and her own,\nit was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without\nmuch reluctance.",
      "As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from\nthe marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that\nElizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude\nand falsehood had before been unknown to her; and, in spite of\neverything, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be\nprevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which\nElizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that, by\nhis wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The\nletter was to this effect:--\n\n/* “My dear Lizzy, */\n\n“I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear\n     Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you\n     so rich; and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will\n     think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very\n     much; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live\n     upon without some help. Any place would do of about three or four\n     hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it,\n     if you had rather not.\n\n“Yours,” etc.",
      "As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in\nher answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.\nSuch relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice\nof what might be called economy in her own private expenses, she\nfrequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an\nincome as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in\ntheir wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to\ntheir support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or\nherself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards\ndischarging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the\nrestoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the\nextreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a\ncheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection\nfor her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted a little longer; and,\nin spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to\nreputation which her marriage had given her. Though Darcy could never\nreceive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth’s sake, he assisted him\nfurther in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when\nher husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the\nBingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long, that even\nBingley’s good-humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_\nof giving them a hint to be gone.",
      "Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s marriage; but as she\nthought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she\ndropped all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as\nattentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility\nto Elizabeth.\n\nPemberley was now Georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the sisters\nwas exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each\nother, even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion\nin the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an\nastonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive manner of\ntalking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect\nwhich almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open\npleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in\nher way. By Elizabeth’s instructions she began to comprehend that a\nwoman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not\nalways allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.",
      "Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;\nand as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in\nher reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him\nlanguage so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time\nall intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion,\nhe was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;\nand, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her\nresentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity\nto see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on\nthem at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had\nreceived, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the\nvisits of her uncle and aunt from the city.\n\nWith the Gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy,\nas well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever\nsensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing\nher into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.\n\n[Illustration:\n\nTHE\n                                  END\n                                   ]\n\nCHISWICK PRESS:--CHARLES WHITTINGHAM AND CO.\n                  TOOKS COURT, CHANCERY LANE, LONDON."

      "In the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the\nUniversity of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course\nprescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,\nI was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant\nSurgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I\ncould join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at\nBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and\nwas already deep in the enemy’s country. I followed, however, with many\nother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\nin reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\nentered upon my new duties.\n\nThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\nnothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and\nattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\nMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\nshattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have\nfallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\ndevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\npack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.",
      "Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\nundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\nthe base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved\nso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\nupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\nof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and\nwhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak\nand emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be\nlost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in\nthe troopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty,\nwith my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a\npaternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to\nimprove it.",
      "I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\nair—or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\npermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\nLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\nthe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a\nprivate hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\nexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\nthan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I\nsoon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\nsomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\nmy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\nup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\npretentious and less expensive domicile.",
      "On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\nthe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\nround I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\nBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London\nis a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had\nnever been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with\nenthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In\nthe exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn,\nand we started off together in a hansom.\n\n“Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?” he asked in\nundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.\n“You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.”\n\nI gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it\nby the time that we reached our destination.\n\n“Poor devil!” he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\nmisfortunes. “What are you up to now?”\n\n“Looking for lodgings,” I answered. “Trying to solve the problem as to\nwhether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.”\n\n“That’s a strange thing,” remarked my companion; “you are the second\nman to-day that has used that expression to me.”\n\n“And who was the first?” I asked.",
      "“A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.\nHe was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone\nto go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which\nwere too much for his purse.”\n\n“By Jove!” I cried, “if he really wants someone to share the rooms and\nthe expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a\npartner to being alone.”\n\nYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. “You\ndon’t know Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not care\nfor him as a constant companion.”\n\n“Why, what is there against him?”\n\n“Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer\nin his ideas—an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I\nknow he is a decent fellow enough.”\n\n“A medical student, I suppose?” said I.\n\n“No—I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is\nwell up in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as\nI know, he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His\nstudies are very desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of\nout-of-the-way knowledge which would astonish his professors.”\n\n“Did you never ask him what he was going in for?” I asked.\n\n“No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\ncommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.”",
      "“I should like to meet him,” I said. “If I am to lodge with anyone, I\nshould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong\nenough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in\nAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How\ncould I meet this friend of yours?”\n\n“He is sure to be at the laboratory,” returned my companion. “He either\navoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to\nnight. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.”\n\n“Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\nchannels.\n\nAs we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford\ngave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to\ntake as a fellow-lodger.\n\n“You mustn’t blame me if you don’t get on with him,” he said; “I know\nnothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally\nin the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold\nme responsible.”\n\n“If we don’t get on it will be easy to part company,” I answered. “It\nseems to me, Stamford,” I added, looking hard at my companion, “that\nyou have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this\nfellow’s temper so formidable, or what is it? Don’t be mealy-mouthed\nabout it.”",
      "“It is not easy to express the inexpressible,” he answered with a\nlaugh. “Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes—it approaches\nto cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch\nof the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you\nunderstand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an\naccurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would\ntake it himself with the same readiness. He appears to have a passion\nfor definite and exact knowledge.”\n\n“Very right too.”\n\n“Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the\nsubjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking\nrather a bizarre shape.”\n\n“Beating the subjects!”\n\n“Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him\nat it with my own eyes.”\n\n“And yet you say he is not a medical student?”",
      "“No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we are,\nand you must form your own impressions about him.” As he spoke, we\nturned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which\nopened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me,\nand I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and\nmade our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall\nand dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage\nbranched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.\n\nThis was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.\nBroad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts,\ntest-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames.\nThere was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant\ntable absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round\nand sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. “I’ve found it! I’ve\nfound it,” he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a\ntest-tube in his hand. “I have found a re-agent which is precipitated\nby hæmoglobin, and by nothing else.” Had he discovered a gold mine,\ngreater delight could not have shone upon his features.\n\n“Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said Stamford, introducing us.",
      "“How are you?” he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for\nwhich I should hardly have given him credit. “You have been in\nAfghanistan, I perceive.”\n\n“How on earth did you know that?” I asked in astonishment.\n\n“Never mind,” said he, chuckling to himself. “The question now is about\nhæmoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of\nmine?”\n\n“It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,” I answered, “but\npractically——”\n\n“Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.\nDon’t you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains.\nCome over here now!” He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness,\nand drew me over to the table at which he had been working. “Let us\nhave some fresh blood,” he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger,\nand drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette.\n“Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You\nperceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water.\nThe proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no\ndoubt, however, that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic\nreaction.” As he spoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals,\nand then added some drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the\ncontents assumed a dull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was\nprecipitated to the bottom of the glass jar.",
      "“Ha! ha!” he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a\nchild with a new toy. “What do you think of that?”\n\n“It seems to be a very delicate test,” I remarked.\n\n“Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and\nuncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The\nlatter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this\nappears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test\nbeen invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who\nwould long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.”\n\n“Indeed!” I murmured.\n\n“Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is\nsuspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His\nlinen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon\nthem. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit\nstains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an\nexpert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the\nSherlock Holmes’ test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.”\n\nHis eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his\nheart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his\nimagination.\n\n“You are to be congratulated,” I remarked, considerably surprised at\nhis enthusiasm.",
      "“There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would\ncertainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there\nwas Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of\nMontpellier, and Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases\nin which it would have been decisive.”\n\n“You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,” said Stamford with a\nlaugh. “You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the ‘Police\nNews of the Past.’”\n\n“Very interesting reading it might be made, too,” remarked Sherlock\nHolmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger.\n“I have to be careful,” he continued, turning to me with a smile, “for\nI dabble with poisons a good deal.” He held out his hand as he spoke,\nand I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of\nplaster, and discoloured with strong acids.\n\n“We came here on business,” said Stamford, sitting down on a high\nthree-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his\nfoot. “My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were\ncomplaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought\nthat I had better bring you together.”\n\nSherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with\nme. “I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,” he said, “which would\nsuit us down to the ground. You don’t mind the smell of strong tobacco,\nI hope?”",
      "“I always smoke ‘ship’s’ myself,” I answered.\n\n“That’s good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally\ndo experiments. Would that annoy you?”\n\n“By no means.”\n\n“Let me see—what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at\ntimes, and don’t open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am\nsulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I’ll soon be right. What\nhave you to confess now? It’s just as well for two fellows to know the\nworst of one another before they begin to live together.”\n\nI laughed at this cross-examination. “I keep a bull pup,” I said, “and\nI object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all\nsorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of\nvices when I’m well, but those are the principal ones at present.”\n\n“Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?” he asked,\nanxiously.\n\n“It depends on the player,” I answered. “A well-played violin is a\ntreat for the gods—a badly-played one——”\n\n“Oh, that’s all right,” he cried, with a merry laugh. “I think we may\nconsider the thing as settled—that is, if the rooms are agreeable to\nyou.”\n\n“When shall we see them?”\n\n“Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we’ll go together and settle\neverything,” he answered.\n\n“All right—noon exactly,” said I, shaking his hand.\n\nWe left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards\nmy hotel.",
      "“By the way,” I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford,\n“how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?”\n\nMy companion smiled an enigmatical smile. “That’s just his little\npeculiarity,” he said. “A good many people have wanted to know how he\nfinds things out.”\n\n“Oh! a mystery is it?” I cried, rubbing my hands. “This is very\npiquant. I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. ‘The proper\nstudy of mankind is man,’ you know.”\n\n“You must study him, then,” Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye.\n“You’ll find him a knotty problem, though. I’ll wager he learns more\nabout you than you about him. Good-bye.”\n\n“Good-bye,” I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably\ninterested in my new acquaintance.\n\nCHAPTER II.\nTHE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION.",
      "We met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No.\n221B, Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They\nconsisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy\nsitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad\nwindows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate\ndid the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was\nconcluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession. That\nvery evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the\nfollowing morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and\nportmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and\nlaying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we gradually\nbegan to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new\nsurroundings.",
      "Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in\nhis ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up\nafter ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out\nbefore I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the\nchemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and\noccasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest\nportions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working\nfit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for\ndays on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly\nuttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night. On these\noccasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes,\nthat I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some\nnarcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life\nforbidden such a notion.",
      "As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his\naims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and\nappearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual\nobserver. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively\nlean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and\npiercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have\nalluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air\nof alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and\nsquareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were\ninvariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was\npossessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had\noccasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile\nphilosophical instruments.",
      "The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how\nmuch this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to\nbreak through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned\nhimself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how\nobjectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my\nattention. My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather\nwas exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me\nand break the monotony of my daily existence. Under these\ncircumstances, I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my\ncompanion, and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.",
      "He was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question,\nconfirmed Stamford’s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to\nhave pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in\nscience or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance\ninto the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was\nremarkable, and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so\nextraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly\nastounded me. Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise\ninformation unless he had some definite end in view. Desultory readers\nare seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning. No man\nburdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason\nfor doing so.\n\nHis ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary\nliterature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to\nnothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way\nwho he might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax,\nhowever, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the\nCopernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System. That any\ncivilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware\nthat the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an\nextraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.",
      "“You appear to be astonished,” he said, smiling at my expression of\nsurprise. “Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.”\n\n“To forget it!”\n\n“You see,” he explained, “I consider that a man’s brain originally is\nlike a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture\nas you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he\ncomes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets\ncrowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so\nthat he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful\nworkman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his\nbrain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in\ndoing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the\nmost perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has\nelastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes\na time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that\nyou knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to\nhave useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.”\n\n“But the Solar System!” I protested.\n\n“What the deuce is it to me?” he interrupted impatiently; “you say that\nwe go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a\npennyworth of difference to me or to my work.”",
      "I was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something\nin his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I\npondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw\nmy deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which\ndid not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which he\npossessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own\nmind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was\nexceptionally well-informed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down.\nI could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It\nran in this way—\n\nSHERLOCK HOLMES—his limits.",
      "1. Knowledge of Literature.—Nil.\n2. Philosophy.—Nil.\n3. Astronomy.—Nil.\n4. Politics.—Feeble.\n5. Botany.—Variable. Well up in belladonna, opium, and poisons\ngenerally. Knows nothing of practical gardening.\n6. Geology.—Practical, but limited. Tells at a glance different soils\nfrom each other. After walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers,\nand told me by their colour and consistence in what part of London he\nhad received them.\n7. Chemistry.—Profound.\n8. Anatomy.—Accurate, but unsystematic.\n9. Sensational Literature.—Immense. He appears to know every detail of\nevery horror perpetrated in the century.\n10. Plays the violin well.\n11.

Has a good practical knowledge of British law.\n\nWhen I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair.\n“If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all\nthese accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all,”\nI said to myself, “I may as well give up the attempt at once.”",
      "I see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. These\nwere very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other\naccomplishments. That he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I\nknew well, because at my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn’s\nLieder, and other favourites. When left to himself, however, he would\nseldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air. Leaning back in\nhis arm-chair of an evening, he would close his eyes and scrape\ncarelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee. Sometimes\nthe chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally they were\nfantastic and cheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts which\npossessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or whether\nthe playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than I\ncould determine. I might have rebelled against these exasperating solos\nhad it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick\nsuccession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation\nfor the trial upon my patience.",
      "During the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think\nthat my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently,\nhowever, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the most\ndifferent classes of society. There was one little sallow rat-faced,\ndark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who came\nthree or four times in a single week. One morning a young girl called,\nfashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same\nafternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew\npedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely\nfollowed by a slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an old\nwhite-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on\nanother a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these\nnondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to\nbeg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room.\nHe always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. “I\nhave to use this room as a place of business,” he said, “and these\npeople are my clients.” Again I had an opportunity of asking him a\npoint blank question, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing\nanother man to confide in me. I imagined at the time that he had some\nstrong reason for not alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by\ncoming round to the subject of his own accord.",
      "It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I\nrose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had\nnot yet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed\nto my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee\nprepared. With the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell\nand gave a curt intimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a\nmagazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it,\nwhile my companion munched silently at his toast. One of the articles\nhad a pencil mark at the heading, and I naturally began to run my eye\nthrough it.",
      "Its somewhat ambitious title was “The Book of Life,” and it attempted\nto show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and\nsystematic examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as\nbeing a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The\nreasoning was close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to\nbe far-fetched and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary\nexpression, a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a\nman’s inmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility\nin the case of one trained to observation and analysis. His conclusions\nwere as infallible as so many propositions of Euclid. So startling\nwould his results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the\nprocesses by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him\nas a necromancer.",
      "“From a drop of water,” said the writer, “a logician could infer the\npossibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of\none or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is\nknown whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts,\nthe Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired\nby long and patient study nor, is life long enough to allow any mortal\nto attain the highest possible perfection in it. Before turning to\nthose moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest\ndifficulties, let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary\nproblems. Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to\ndistinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to\nwhich he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the\nfaculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to\nlook for. By a man’s finger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by\nhis trouser knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by\nhis expression, by his shirt cuffs—by each of these things a man’s\ncalling is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten\nthe competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.”\n\n“What ineffable twaddle!” I cried, slapping the magazine down on the\ntable, “I never read such rubbish in my life.”\n\n“What is it?” asked Sherlock Holmes.",
      "“Why, this article,” I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I sat\ndown to my breakfast. “I see that you have read it since you have\nmarked it. I don’t deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me\nthough. It is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who\nevolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own\nstudy. It is not practical. I should like to see him clapped down in a\nthird class carriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades\nof all his fellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against\nhim.”\n\n“You would lose your money,” Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly. “As for\nthe article, I wrote it myself.”\n\n“You!”\n\n“Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The\ntheories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so\nchimerical are really extremely practical—so practical that I depend\nupon them for my bread and cheese.”\n\n“And how?” I asked involuntarily.",
      "“Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the\nworld. I’m a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is.\nHere in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of\nprivate ones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I\nmanage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before\nme, and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history\nof crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance\nabout misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your\nfinger ends, it is odd if you can’t unravel the thousand and first.\nLestrade is a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently\nover a forgery case, and that was what brought him here.”\n\n“And these other people?”\n\n“They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are all\npeople who are in trouble about something, and want a little\nenlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and\nthen I pocket my fee.”\n\n“But do you mean to say,” I said, “that without leaving your room you\ncan unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although\nthey have seen every detail for themselves?”",
      "“Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case\nturns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about\nand see things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special\nknowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters\nwonderfully. Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which\naroused your scorn, are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation\nwith me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you,\non our first meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.”\n\n“You were told, no doubt.”",
      "“Nothing of the sort. I _knew_ you came from Afghanistan. From long\nhabit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I\narrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate\nsteps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran,\n‘Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military\nman. Clearly an army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics,\nfor his face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for\nhis wrists are fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his\nhaggard face says clearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it\nin a stiff and unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English\narmy doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in\nAfghanistan.’ The whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I\nthen remarked that you came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.”\n\n“It is simple enough as you explain it,” I said, smiling. “You remind\nme of Edgar Allen Poe’s Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did\nexist outside of stories.”",
      "Sherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. “No doubt you think that you are\ncomplimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,” he observed. “Now, in my\nopinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of\nbreaking in on his friends’ thoughts with an apropos remark after a\nquarter of an hour’s silence is really very showy and superficial. He\nhad some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a\nphenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine.”\n\n“Have you read Gaboriau’s works?” I asked. “Does Lecoq come up to your\nidea of a detective?”\n\nSherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. “Lecoq was a miserable bungler,”\nhe said, in an angry voice; “he had only one thing to recommend him,\nand that was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question\nwas how to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in\ntwenty-four hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a\ntext-book for detectives to teach them what to avoid.”\n\nI felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired\ntreated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood\nlooking out into the busy street. “This fellow may be very clever,” I\nsaid to myself, “but he is certainly very conceited.”",
      "“There are no crimes and no criminals in these days,” he said,\nquerulously. “What is the use of having brains in our profession. I\nknow well that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or\nhas ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural\ntalent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the\nresult? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling\nvillainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard\nofficial can see through it.”\n\nI was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought\nit best to change the topic.\n\n“I wonder what that fellow is looking for?” I asked, pointing to a\nstalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the\nother side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had a\nlarge blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a\nmessage.\n\n“You mean the retired sergeant of Marines,” said Sherlock Holmes.\n\n“Brag and bounce!” thought I to myself. “He knows that I cannot verify\nhis guess.”\n\nThe thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were\nwatching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across\nthe roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps\nascending the stair.\n\n“For Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” he said, stepping into the room and handing\nmy friend the letter.",
      "Here was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little\nthought of this when he made that random shot. “May I ask, my lad,” I\nsaid, in the blandest voice, “what your trade may be?”\n\n“Commissionaire, sir,” he said, gruffly. “Uniform away for repairs.”\n\n“And you were?” I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my\ncompanion.\n\n“A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right,\nsir.”\n\nHe clicked his heels together, raised his hand in a salute, and was\ngone.\n\nCHAPTER III.\nTHE LAURISTON GARDENS MYSTERY\n\nI confess that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the\npractical nature of my companion’s theories. My respect for his powers\nof analysis increased wondrously. There still remained some lurking\nsuspicion in my mind, however, that the whole thing was a pre-arranged\nepisode, intended to dazzle me, though what earthly object he could\nhave in taking me in was past my comprehension. When I looked at him he\nhad finished reading the note, and his eyes had assumed the vacant,\nlack-lustre expression which showed mental abstraction.\n\n“How in the world did you deduce that?” I asked.\n\n“Deduce what?” said he, petulantly.\n\n“Why, that he was a retired sergeant of Marines.”",
      "“I have no time for trifles,” he answered, brusquely; then with a\nsmile, “Excuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts; but\nperhaps it is as well. So you actually were not able to see that that\nman was a sergeant of Marines?”\n\n“No, indeed.”\n\n“It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it. If you were\nasked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some\ndifficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact. Even across the\nstreet I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the\nfellow’s hand. That smacked of the sea. He had a military carriage,\nhowever, and regulation side whiskers. There we have the marine. He was\na man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of command.\nYou must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung his\ncane. A steady, respectable, middle-aged man, too, on the face of\nhim—all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant.”\n\n“Wonderful!” I ejaculated.\n\n“Commonplace,” said Holmes, though I thought from his expression that\nhe was pleased at my evident surprise and admiration. “I said just now\nthat there were no criminals. It appears that I am wrong—look at this!”\nHe threw me over the note which the commissionaire had brought.\n\n“Why,” I cried, as I cast my eye over it, “this is terrible!”",
      "“It does seem to be a little out of the common,” he remarked, calmly.\n“Would you mind reading it to me aloud?”\n\nThis is the letter which I read to him—\n\n“MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—\n\n“There has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston\nGardens, off the Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there\nabout two in the morning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected\nthat something was amiss. He found the door open, and in the front\nroom, which is bare of furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman,\nwell dressed, and having cards in his pocket bearing the name of ‘Enoch\nJ. Drebber, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.’ There had been no robbery, nor is\nthere any evidence as to how the man met his death. There are marks of\nblood in the room, but there is no wound upon his person. We are at a\nloss as to how he came into the empty house; indeed, the whole affair\nis a puzzler. If you can come round to the house any time before\ntwelve, you will find me there. I have left everything _in statu quo_\nuntil I hear from you. If you are unable to come I shall give you\nfuller details, and would esteem it a great kindness if you would\nfavour me with your opinion.\n\nYours faithfully,\n                  “TOBIAS GREGSON.”",
      "“Gregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,” my friend remarked;\n“he and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick and\nenergetic, but conventional—shockingly so. They have their knives into\none another, too. They are as jealous as a pair of professional\nbeauties. There will be some fun over this case if they are both put\nupon the scent.”\n\nI was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on. “Surely there is\nnot a moment to be lost,” I cried, “shall I go and order you a cab?”\n\n“I’m not sure about whether I shall go. I am the most incurably lazy\ndevil that ever stood in shoe leather—that is, when the fit is on me,\nfor I can be spry enough at times.”\n\n“Why, it is just such a chance as you have been longing for.”\n\n“My dear fellow, what does it matter to me. Supposing I unravel the\nwhole matter, you may be sure that Gregson, Lestrade, and Co. will\npocket all the credit. That comes of being an unofficial personage.”\n\n“But he begs you to help him.”\n\n“Yes. He knows that I am his superior, and acknowledges it to me; but\nhe would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person.\nHowever, we may as well go and have a look. I shall work it out on my\nown hook. I may have a laugh at them if I have nothing else. Come on!”\n\nHe hustled on his overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed that\nan energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one.",
      "“Get your hat,” he said.\n\n“You wish me to come?”\n\n“Yes, if you have nothing better to do.” A minute later we were both in\na hansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road.\n\nIt was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the\nhouse-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets\nbeneath. My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away\nabout Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and an\nAmati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the\nmelancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits.\n\n“You don’t seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,” I said at\nlast, interrupting Holmes’ musical disquisition.\n\n“No data yet,” he answered. “It is a capital mistake to theorize before\nyou have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.”\n\n“You will have your data soon,” I remarked, pointing with my finger;\n“this is the Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very much\nmistaken.”\n\n“So it is. Stop, driver, stop!” We were still a hundred yards or so\nfrom it, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our\njourney upon foot.",
      "Number 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It\nwas one of four which stood back some little way from the street, two\nbeing occupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of\nvacant melancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here\nand there a “To Let” card had developed like a cataract upon the\nbleared panes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption\nof sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street, and\nwas traversed by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting\napparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very\nsloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night. The garden was\nbounded by a three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the\ntop, and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable,\nsurrounded by a small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and\nstrained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the\nproceedings within.",
      "I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the\nhouse and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be\nfurther from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the\ncircumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up\nand down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the\nopposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny,\nhe proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass\nwhich flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice\nhe stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an\nexclamation of satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon\nthe wet clayey soil, but since the police had been coming and going\nover it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn\nanything from it. Still I had had such extraordinary evidence of the\nquickness of his perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he\ncould see a great deal which was hidden from me.\n\nAt the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced,\nflaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and\nwrung my companion’s hand with effusion. “It is indeed kind of you to\ncome,” he said, “I have had everything left untouched.”",
      "“Except that!” my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. “If a herd\nof buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No\ndoubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you\npermitted this.”\n\n“I have had so much to do inside the house,” the detective said\nevasively. “My colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon him\nto look after this.”\n\nHolmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. “With two\nsuch men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be\nmuch for a third party to find out,” he said.\n\nGregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. “I think we have done\nall that can be done,” he answered; “it’s a queer case though, and I\nknew your taste for such things.”\n\n“You did not come here in a cab?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“Nor Lestrade?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“Then let us go and look at the room.” With which inconsequent remark\nhe strode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features\nexpressed his astonishment.",
      "A short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and\noffices. Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One\nof these had obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged\nto the dining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious\naffair had occurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that\nsubdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires.\n\nIt was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence of\nall furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was\nblotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had\nbecome detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath.\nOpposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of\nimitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a\nred wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light was\nhazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was\nintensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole\napartment.",
      "All these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was\ncentred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon\nthe boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured\nceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of\nage, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and\na short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat\nand waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar and\ncuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor\nbeside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while\nhis lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been\na grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror,\nand as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human\nfeatures. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low\nforehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a\nsingularly simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his\nwrithing, unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never\nhas it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy\napartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban\nLondon.\n\nLestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway,\nand greeted my companion and myself.",
      "“This case will make a stir, sir,” he remarked. “It beats anything I\nhave seen, and I am no chicken.”\n\n“There is no clue?” said Gregson.\n\n“None at all,” chimed in Lestrade.\n\nSherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it\nintently. “You are sure that there is no wound?” he asked, pointing to\nnumerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.\n\n“Positive!” cried both detectives.\n\n“Then, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual—presumably\nthe murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of the\ncircumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in the\nyear ‘34. Do you remember the case, Gregson?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“Read it up—you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It\nhas all been done before.”\n\nAs he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and\neverywhere, feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes\nwore the same far-away expression which I have already remarked upon.\nSo swiftly was the examination made, that one would hardly have guessed\nthe minuteness with which it was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the\ndead man’s lips, and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather\nboots.\n\n“He has not been moved at all?” he asked.\n\n“No more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination.”\n\n“You can take him to the mortuary now,” he said. “There is nothing more\nto be learned.”",
      "Gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand. At his call they entered\nthe room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised\nhim, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbed\nit up and stared at it with mystified eyes.\n\n“There’s been a woman here,” he cried. “It’s a woman’s wedding-ring.”\n\nHe held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered\nround him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of\nplain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.\n\n“This complicates matters,” said Gregson. “Heaven knows, they were\ncomplicated enough before.”\n\n“You’re sure it doesn’t simplify them?” observed Holmes. “There’s\nnothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his\npockets?”\n\n“We have it all here,” said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects\nupon one of the bottom steps of the stairs. “A gold watch, No. 97163,\nby Barraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold\nring, with masonic device. Gold pin—bull-dog’s head, with rubies as\neyes. Russian leather card-case, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of\nCleveland, corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. No purse,\nbut loose money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen. Pocket edition\nof Boccaccio’s _Decameron_, with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the\nfly-leaf. Two letters—one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph\nStangerson.”",
      "“At what address?”\n\n“American Exchange, Strand—to be left till called for. They are both\nfrom the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their\nboats from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about\nto return to New York.”\n\n“Have you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson?”\n\n“I did it at once, sir,” said Gregson. “I have had advertisements sent\nto all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American\nExchange, but he has not returned yet.”\n\n“Have you sent to Cleveland?”\n\n“We telegraphed this morning.”\n\n“How did you word your inquiries?”\n\n“We simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad\nof any information which could help us.”\n\n“You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to\nbe crucial?”\n\n“I asked about Stangerson.”\n\n“Nothing else? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case\nappears to hinge? Will you not telegraph again?”\n\n“I have said all I have to say,” said Gregson, in an offended voice.\n\nSherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make\nsome remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we\nwere holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene,\nrubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.",
      "“Mr. Gregson,” he said, “I have just made a discovery of the highest\nimportance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a\ncareful examination of the walls.”\n\nThe little man’s eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in a\nstate of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his\ncolleague.\n\n“Come here,” he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of\nwhich felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. “Now, stand\nthere!”\n\nHe struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.\n\n“Look at that!” he said, triumphantly.\n\nI have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this\nparticular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a\nyellow square of coarse plastering. Across this bare space there was\nscrawled in blood-red letters a single word—\n\nRACHE.",
      "“What do you think of that?” cried the detective, with the air of a\nshowman exhibiting his show. “This was overlooked because it was in the\ndarkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. The\nmurderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where\nit has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide\nanyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you. See\nthat candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was\nlit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion\nof the wall.”\n\n“And what does it mean now that you _have_ found it?” asked Gregson in\na depreciatory voice.\n\n“Mean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name\nRachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark\nmy words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a\nwoman named Rachel has something to do with it. It’s all very well for\nyou to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever,\nbut the old hound is the best, when all is said and done.”",
      "“I really beg your pardon!” said my companion, who had ruffled the\nlittle man’s temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. “You\ncertainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out,\nand, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the\nother participant in last night’s mystery. I have not had time to\nexamine this room yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.”",
      "As he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying\nglass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly\nabout the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once\nlying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that\nhe appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to\nhimself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire of\nexclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of\nencouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded\nof a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and\nforwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes\nacross the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his\nresearches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between\nmarks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying\nhis tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one\nplace he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the\nfloor, and packed it away in an envelope. Finally, he examined with his\nglass the word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the\nmost minute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he\nreplaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.",
      "“They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,” he\nremarked with a smile. “It’s a very bad definition, but it does apply\nto detective work.”\n\nGregson and Lestrade had watched the manœuvres of their amateur\ncompanion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They evidently\nfailed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that\nSherlock Holmes’ smallest actions were all directed towards some\ndefinite and practical end.\n\n“What do you think of it, sir?” they both asked.\n\n“It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume\nto help you,” remarked my friend. “You are doing so well now that it\nwould be a pity for anyone to interfere.” There was a world of sarcasm\nin his voice as he spoke. “If you will let me know how your\ninvestigations go,” he continued, “I shall be happy to give you any\nhelp I can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who\nfound the body. Can you give me his name and address?”\n\nLestrade glanced at his note-book. “John Rance,” he said. “He is off\nduty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate.”\n\nHolmes took a note of the address.",
      "“Come along, Doctor,” he said; “we shall go and look him up. I’ll tell\nyou one thing which may help you in the case,” he continued, turning to\nthe two detectives. “There has been murder done, and the murderer was a\nman. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had\nsmall feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a\nTrichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab,\nwhich was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his\noff fore leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and\nthe finger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long. These are only\na few indications, but they may assist you.”\n\nLestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.\n\n“If this man was murdered, how was it done?” asked the former.\n\n“Poison,” said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. “One other\nthing, Lestrade,” he added, turning round at the door: “‘Rache,’ is the\nGerman for ‘revenge’; so don’t lose your time looking for Miss Rachel.”\n\nWith which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals\nopen-mouthed behind him.\n\nCHAPTER IV.\nWHAT JOHN RANCE HAD TO TELL.",
      "It was one o’clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock\nHolmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a\nlong telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us\nto the address given us by Lestrade.\n\n“There is nothing like first hand evidence,” he remarked; “as a matter\nof fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as\nwell learn all that is to be learned.”\n\n“You amaze me, Holmes,” said I. “Surely you are not as sure as you\npretend to be of all those particulars which you gave.”\n\n“There’s no room for a mistake,” he answered. “The very first thing\nwhich I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts\nwith its wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had\nno rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep\nimpression must have been there during the night. There were the marks\nof the horse’s hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more\nclearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was a new\nshoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not there\nat any time during the morning—I have Gregson’s word for that—it\nfollows that it must have been there during the night, and, therefore,\nthat it brought those two individuals to the house.”\n\n“That seems simple enough,” said I; “but how about the other man’s\nheight?”",
      "“Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from\nthe length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though\nthere is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow’s stride\nboth on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of\nchecking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct\nleads him to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that writing\nwas just over six feet from the ground. It was child’s play.”\n\n“And his age?” I asked.\n\n“Well, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest\neffort, he can’t be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth\nof a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across.\nPatent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over.\nThere is no mystery about it at all. I am simply applying to ordinary\nlife a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I\nadvocated in that article. Is there anything else that puzzles you?”\n\n“The finger nails and the Trichinopoly,” I suggested.",
      "“The writing on the wall was done with a man’s forefinger dipped in\nblood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly\nscratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man’s\nnail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor.\nIt was dark in colour and flakey—such an ash as is only made by a\nTrichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar ashes—in fact, I\nhave written a monograph upon the subject. I flatter myself that I can\ndistinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand, either of cigar or\nof tobacco. It is just in such details that the skilled detective\ndiffers from the Gregson and Lestrade type.”\n\n“And the florid face?” I asked.\n\n“Ah, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was\nright. You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.”",
      "I passed my hand over my brow. “My head is in a whirl,” I remarked;\n“the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these\ntwo men—if there were two men—into an empty house? What has become of\nthe cabman who drove them? How could one man compel another to take\npoison? Where did the blood come from? What was the object of the\nmurderer, since robbery had no part in it? How came the woman’s ring\nthere? Above all, why should the second man write up the German word\nRACHE before decamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible way of\nreconciling all these facts.”\n\nMy companion smiled approvingly.",
      "“You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,” he\nsaid. “There is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up\nmy mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade’s discovery it was\nsimply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by\nsuggesting Socialism and secret societies. It was not done by a German.\nThe A, if you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion.\nNow, a real German invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we\nmay safely say that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy\nimitator who overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry\ninto a wrong channel. I’m not going to tell you much more of the case,\nDoctor. You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained\nhis trick, and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will\ncome to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.”\n\n“I shall never do that,” I answered; “you have brought detection as\nnear an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.”\n\nMy companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way\nin which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as\nsensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of\nher beauty.",
      "“I’ll tell you one other thing,” he said. “Patent-leathers and\nSquare-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway\ntogether as friendly as possible—arm-in-arm, in all probability. When\nthey got inside they walked up and down the room—or rather,\nPatent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. I\ncould read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked he\ngrew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length of\nhis strides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up, no\ndoubt, into a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I’ve told you all I know\nmyself now, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good\nworking basis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want\nto go to Halle’s concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon.”\n\nThis conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way\nthrough a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In the\ndingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand.\n“That’s Audley Court in there,” he said, pointing to a narrow slit in\nthe line of dead-coloured brick. “You’ll find me here when you come\nback.”",
      "Audley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us\ninto a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. We\npicked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of\ndiscoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which was\ndecorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was\nengraved. On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we\nwere shown into a little front parlour to await his coming.\n\nHe appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed in\nhis slumbers. “I made my report at the office,” he said.\n\nHolmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it\npensively. “We thought that we should like to hear it all from your own\nlips,” he said.\n\n“I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,” the constable\nanswered with his eyes upon the little golden disk.\n\n“Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred.”\n\nRance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows as though\ndetermined not to omit anything in his narrative.",
      "“I’ll tell it ye from the beginning,” he said. “My time is from ten at\nnight to six in the morning. At eleven there was a fight at the ‘White\nHart’; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one o’clock it\nbegan to rain, and I met Harry Murcher—him who has the Holland Grove\nbeat—and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin’.\nPresently—maybe about two or a little after—I thought I would take a\nlook round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road. It was\nprecious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all the way down,\nthough a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin’ down, thinkin’\nbetween ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, when\nsuddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same\nhouse. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty\non account of him that owns them who won’t have the drains seen to,\nthough the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o’ typhoid\nfever. I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in the\nwindow, and I suspected as something was wrong. When I got to the\ndoor——”\n\n“You stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,” my companion\ninterrupted. “What did you do that for?”\n\nRance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the\nutmost amazement upon his features.",
      "“Why, that’s true, sir,” he said; “though how you come to know it,\nHeaven only knows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still\nand so lonesome, that I thought I’d be none the worse for some one with\nme. I ain’t afeared of anything on this side o’ the grave; but I\nthought that maybe it was him that died o’ the typhoid inspecting the\ndrains what killed him. The thought gave me a kind o’ turn, and I\nwalked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher’s lantern, but\nthere wasn’t no sign of him nor of anyone else.”\n\n“There was no one in the street?”\n\n“Not a livin’ soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself\ntogether and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet inside,\nso I went into the room where the light was a-burnin’. There was a\ncandle flickerin’ on the mantelpiece—a red wax one—and by its light I\nsaw——”\n\n“Yes, I know all that you saw. You walked round the room several times,\nand you knelt down by the body, and then you walked through and tried\nthe kitchen door, and then——”\n\nJohn Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in\nhis eyes. “Where was you hid to see all that?” he cried. “It seems to\nme that you knows a deal more than you should.”",
      "Holmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable.\n“Don’t get arresting me for the murder,” he said. “I am one of the\nhounds and not the wolf; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for\nthat. Go on, though. What did you do next?”\n\nRance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified\nexpression. “I went back to the gate and sounded my whistle. That\nbrought Murcher and two more to the spot.”\n\n“Was the street empty then?”\n\n“Well, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\nThe constable’s features broadened into a grin. “I’ve seen many a drunk\nchap in my time,” he said, “but never anyone so cryin’ drunk as that\ncove. He was at the gate when I came out, a-leanin’ up agin the\nrailings, and a-singin’ at the pitch o’ his lungs about Columbine’s\nNew-fangled Banner, or some such stuff. He couldn’t stand, far less\nhelp.”\n\n“What sort of a man was he?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\n\nJohn Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression. “He\nwas an uncommon drunk sort o’ man,” he said. “He’d ha’ found hisself in\nthe station if we hadn’t been so took up.”\n\n“His face—his dress—didn’t you notice them?” Holmes broke in\nimpatiently.\n\n“I should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him up—me\nand Murcher between us. He was a long chap, with a red face, the lower\npart muffled round——”",
      "“That will do,” cried Holmes. “What became of him?”\n\n“We’d enough to do without lookin’ after him,” the policeman said, in\nan aggrieved voice. “I’ll wager he found his way home all right.”\n\n“How was he dressed?”\n\n“A brown overcoat.”\n\n“Had he a whip in his hand?”\n\n“A whip—no.”\n\n“He must have left it behind,” muttered my companion. “You didn’t\nhappen to see or hear a cab after that?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“There’s a half-sovereign for you,” my companion said, standing up and\ntaking his hat. “I am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in the\nforce. That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament. You\nmight have gained your sergeant’s stripes last night. The man whom you\nheld in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery, and\nwhom we are seeking. There is no use of arguing about it now; I tell\nyou that it is so. Come along, Doctor.”\n\nWe started off for the cab together, leaving our informant incredulous,\nbut obviously uncomfortable.\n\n“The blundering fool,” Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to our\nlodgings. “Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good\nluck, and not taking advantage of it.”\n\n“I am rather in the dark still. It is true that the description of this\nman tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery. But why\nshould he come back to the house after leaving it? That is not the way\nof criminals.”",
      "“The ring, man, the ring: that was what he came back for. If we have no\nother way of catching him, we can always bait our line with the ring. I\nshall have him, Doctor—I’ll lay you two to one that I have him. I must\nthank you for it all. I might not have gone but for you, and so have\nmissed the finest study I ever came across: a study in scarlet, eh? Why\nshouldn’t we use a little art jargon. There’s the scarlet thread of\nmurder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to\nunravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it. And now for\nlunch, and then for Norman Neruda. Her attack and her bowing are\nsplendid. What’s that little thing of Chopin’s she plays so\nmagnificently: Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay.”\n\nLeaning back in the cab, this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a\nlark while I meditated upon the many-sidedness of the human mind.\n\nCHAPTER V.\nOUR ADVERTISEMENT BRINGS A VISITOR.",
      "Our morning’s exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I was\ntired out in the afternoon. After Holmes’ departure for the concert, I\nlay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours’ sleep.\nIt was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that\nhad occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it.\nEvery time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted\nbaboon-like countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was the\nimpression which that face had produced upon me that I found it\ndifficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its\nowner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most\nmalignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of\nCleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be done, and that the\ndepravity of the victim was no condonement in the eyes of the law.",
      "The more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion’s\nhypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how he\nhad sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected something\nwhich had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not poison, what had\ncaused the man’s death, since there was neither wound nor marks of\nstrangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay\nso thickly upon the floor? There were no signs of a struggle, nor had\nthe victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist.\nAs long as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would\nbe no easy matter, either for Holmes or myself. His quiet\nself-confident manner convinced me that he had already formed a theory\nwhich explained all the facts, though what it was I could not for an\ninstant conjecture.\n\nHe was very late in returning—so late, that I knew that the concert\ncould not have detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table\nbefore he appeared.\n\n“It was magnificent,” he said, as he took his seat. “Do you remember\nwhat Darwin says about music? He claims that the power of producing and\nappreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of\nspeech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced\nby it. There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries\nwhen the world was in its childhood.”",
      "“That’s rather a broad idea,” I remarked.\n\n“One’s ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret\nNature,” he answered. “What’s the matter? You’re not looking quite\nyourself. This Brixton Road affair has upset you.”\n\n“To tell the truth, it has,” I said. “I ought to be more case-hardened\nafter my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at\nMaiwand without losing my nerve.”\n\n“I can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the\nimagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have you\nseen the evening paper?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“It gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention the\nfact that when the man was raised up, a woman’s wedding ring fell upon\nthe floor. It is just as well it does not.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Look at this advertisement,” he answered. “I had one sent to every\npaper this morning immediately after the affair.”\n\nHe threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated.\nIt was the first announcement in the “Found” column. “In Brixton Road,\nthis morning,” it ran, “a plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadway\nbetween the ‘White Hart’ Tavern and Holland Grove. Apply Dr. Watson,\n221B, Baker Street, between eight and nine this evening.”\n\n“Excuse my using your name,” he said. “If I used my own some of these\ndunderheads would recognize it, and want to meddle in the affair.”",
      "“That is all right,” I answered. “But supposing anyone applies, I have\nno ring.”\n\n“Oh yes, you have,” said he, handing me one. “This will do very well.\nIt is almost a facsimile.”\n\n“And who do you expect will answer this advertisement.”\n\n“Why, the man in the brown coat—our florid friend with the square toes.\nIf he does not come himself he will send an accomplice.”\n\n“Would he not consider it as too dangerous?”",
      "“Not at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason\nto believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose\nthe ring. According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over\nDrebber’s body, and did not miss it at the time. After leaving the\nhouse he discovered his loss and hurried back, but found the police\nalready in possession, owing to his own folly in leaving the candle\nburning. He had to pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions\nwhich might have been aroused by his appearance at the gate. Now put\nyourself in that man’s place. On thinking the matter over, it must have\noccurred to him that it was possible that he had lost the ring in the\nroad after leaving the house. What would he do, then? He would eagerly\nlook out for the evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the\narticles found. His eye, of course, would light upon this. He would be\noverjoyed. Why should he fear a trap? There would be no reason in his\neyes why the finding of the ring should be connected with the murder.\nHe would come. He will come. You shall see him within an hour?”\n\n“And then?” I asked.\n\n“Oh, you can leave me to deal with him then. Have you any arms?”\n\n“I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges.”\n\n“You had better clean it and load it. He will be a desperate man, and\nthough I shall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for\nanything.”",
      "I went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned with the\npistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his\nfavourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.\n\n“The plot thickens,” he said, as I entered; “I have just had an answer\nto my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct one.”\n\n“And that is?” I asked eagerly.\n\n“My fiddle would be the better for new strings,” he remarked. “Put your\npistol in your pocket. When the fellow comes speak to him in an\nordinary way. Leave the rest to me. Don’t frighten him by looking at\nhim too hard.”\n\n“It is eight o’clock now,” I said, glancing at my watch.\n\n“Yes. He will probably be here in a few minutes. Open the door\nslightly. That will do. Now put the key on the inside. Thank you! This\nis a queer old book I picked up at a stall yesterday—‘De Jure inter\nGentes’—published in Latin at Liege in the Lowlands, in 1642. Charles’\nhead was still firm on his shoulders when this little brown-backed\nvolume was struck off.”\n\n“Who is the printer?”\n\n“Philippe de Croy, whoever he may have been. On the fly-leaf, in very\nfaded ink, is written ‘Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte.’ I wonder who William\nWhyte was. Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I suppose. His\nwriting has a legal twist about it. Here comes our man, I think.”",
      "As he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. Sherlock Holmes rose\nsoftly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. We heard the\nservant pass along the hall, and the sharp click of the latch as she\nopened it.\n\n“Does Dr. Watson live here?” asked a clear but rather harsh voice. We\ncould not hear the servant’s reply, but the door closed, and some one\nbegan to ascend the stairs. The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling\none. A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he\nlistened to it. It came slowly along the passage, and there was a\nfeeble tap at the door.\n\n“Come in,” I cried.\n\nAt my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very\nold and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. She appeared to be\ndazzled by the sudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, she\nstood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket\nwith nervous, shaky fingers. I glanced at my companion, and his face\nhad assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do\nto keep my countenance.",
      "The old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our\nadvertisement. “It’s this as has brought me, good gentlemen,” she said,\ndropping another curtsey; “a gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road. It\nbelongs to my girl Sally, as was married only this time twelvemonth,\nwhich her husband is steward aboard a Union boat, and what he’d say if\nhe come ‘ome and found her without her ring is more than I can think,\nhe being short enough at the best o’ times, but more especially when he\nhas the drink. If it please you, she went to the circus last night\nalong with——”\n\n“Is that her ring?” I asked.\n\n“The Lord be thanked!” cried the old woman; “Sally will be a glad woman\nthis night. That’s the ring.”\n\n“And what may your address be?” I inquired, taking up a pencil.\n\n“13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch. A weary way from here.”\n\n“The Brixton Road does not lie between any circus and Houndsditch,”\nsaid Sherlock Holmes sharply.\n\nThe old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little\nred-rimmed eyes. “The gentleman asked me for _my_ address,” she said.\n“Sally lives in lodgings at 3, Mayfield Place, Peckham.”\n\n“And your name is——?”\n\n“My name is Sawyer—hers is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her—and a\nsmart, clean lad, too, as long as he’s at sea, and no steward in the\ncompany more thought of; but when on shore, what with the women and\nwhat with liquor shops——”",
      "“Here is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,” I interrupted, in obedience to a sign\nfrom my companion; “it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad\nto be able to restore it to the rightful owner.”\n\nWith many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old\ncrone packed it away in her pocket, and shuffled off down the stairs.\nSherlock Holmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and\nrushed into his room. He returned in a few seconds enveloped in an\nulster and a cravat. “I’ll follow her,” he said, hurriedly; “she must\nbe an accomplice, and will lead me to him. Wait up for me.” The hall\ndoor had hardly slammed behind our visitor before Holmes had descended\nthe stair. Looking through the window I could see her walking feebly\nalong the other side, while her pursuer dogged her some little distance\nbehind. “Either his whole theory is incorrect,” I thought to myself,\n“or else he will be led now to the heart of the mystery.” There was no\nneed for him to ask me to wait up for him, for I felt that sleep was\nimpossible until I heard the result of his adventure.",
      "It was close upon nine when he set out. I had no idea how long he might\nbe, but I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages\nof Henri Murger’s “Vie de Bohème.” Ten o’clock passed, and I heard the\nfootsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed. Eleven, and the more\nstately tread of the landlady passed my door, bound for the same\ndestination. It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound of\nhis latch-key. The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had not\nbeen successful. Amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the\nmastery, until the former suddenly carried the day, and he burst into a\nhearty laugh.\n\n“I wouldn’t have the Scotland Yarders know it for the world,” he cried,\ndropping into his chair; “I have chaffed them so much that they would\nnever have let me hear the end of it. I can afford to laugh, because I\nknow that I will be even with them in the long run.”\n\n“What is it then?” I asked.",
      "“Oh, I don’t mind telling a story against myself. That creature had\ngone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being\nfoot-sore. Presently she came to a halt, and hailed a four-wheeler\nwhich was passing. I managed to be close to her so as to hear the\naddress, but I need not have been so anxious, for she sang it out loud\nenough to be heard at the other side of the street, ‘Drive to 13,\nDuncan Street, Houndsditch,’ she cried. This begins to look genuine, I\nthought, and having seen her safely inside, I perched myself behind.\nThat’s an art which every detective should be an expert at. Well, away\nwe rattled, and never drew rein until we reached the street in\nquestion. I hopped off before we came to the door, and strolled down\nthe street in an easy, lounging way. I saw the cab pull up. The driver\njumped down, and I saw him open the door and stand expectantly. Nothing\ncame out though. When I reached him he was groping about frantically in\nthe empty cab, and giving vent to the finest assorted collection of\noaths that ever I listened to. There was no sign or trace of his\npassenger, and I fear it will be some time before he gets his fare. On\ninquiring at Number 13 we found that the house belonged to a\nrespectable paperhanger, named Keswick, and that no one of the name\neither of Sawyer or Dennis had ever been heard of there.”",
      "“You don’t mean to say,” I cried, in amazement, “that that tottering,\nfeeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion,\nwithout either you or the driver seeing her?”\n\n“Old woman be damned!” said Sherlock Holmes, sharply. “We were the old\nwomen to be so taken in. It must have been a young man, and an active\none, too, besides being an incomparable actor. The get-up was\ninimitable. He saw that he was followed, no doubt, and used this means\nof giving me the slip. It shows that the man we are after is not as\nlonely as I imagined he was, but has friends who are ready to risk\nsomething for him. Now, Doctor, you are looking done-up. Take my advice\nand turn in.”\n\nI was certainly feeling very weary, so I obeyed his injunction. I left\nHolmes seated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into the\nwatches of the night I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his\nviolin, and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem\nwhich he had set himself to unravel.\n\nCHAPTER VI.\nTOBIAS GREGSON SHOWS WHAT HE CAN DO.\n\nThe papers next day were full of the “Brixton Mystery,” as they termed\nit. Each had a long account of the affair, and some had leaders upon it\nin addition. There was some information in them which was new to me. I\nstill retain in my scrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bearing\nupon the case. Here is a condensation of a few of them:—",
      "The _Daily Telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there had\nseldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German\nname of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister\ninscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political\nrefugees and revolutionists. The Socialists had many branches in\nAmerica, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten\nlaws, and been tracked down by them. After alluding airily to the\nVehmgericht, aqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers,\nthe Darwinian theory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff\nHighway murders, the article concluded by admonishing the Government\nand advocating a closer watch over foreigners in England.",
      "The _Standard_ commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the\nsort usually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from\nthe unsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening\nof all authority. The deceased was an American gentleman who had been\nresiding for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed at the\nboarding-house of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell.\nHe was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary, Mr. Joseph\nStangerson. The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday, the 4th\ninst., and departed to Euston Station with the avowed intention of\ncatching the Liverpool express. They were afterwards seen together upon\nthe platform. Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber’s body\nwas, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road,\nmany miles from Euston. How he came there, or how he met his fate, are\nquestions which are still involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the\nwhereabouts of Stangerson. We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and\nMr. Gregson, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and it\nis confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily\nthrow light upon the matter.",
      "The _Daily News_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being\na political one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated\nthe Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores\na number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not\nsoured by the recollection of all that they had undergone. Among these\nmen there was a stringent code of honour, any infringement of which was\npunished by death. Every effort should be made to find the secretary,\nStangerson, and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the\ndeceased. A great step had been gained by the discovery of the address\nof the house at which he had boarded—a result which was entirely due to\nthe acuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland Yard.\n\nSherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast,\nand they appeared to afford him considerable amusement.\n\n“I told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure\nto score.”\n\n“That depends on how it turns out.”\n\n“Oh, bless you, it doesn’t matter in the least. If the man is caught,\nit will be _on account_ of their exertions; if he escapes, it will be\n_in spite_ of their exertions. It’s heads I win and tails you lose.\nWhatever they do, they will have followers. ‘Un sot trouve toujours un\nplus sot qui l’admire.’”",
      "“What on earth is this?” I cried, for at this moment there came the\npattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs, accompanied by\naudible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady.\n\n“It’s the Baker Street division of the detective police force,” said my\ncompanion, gravely; and as he spoke there rushed into the room half a\ndozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that ever I clapped\neyes on.\n\n“‘Tention!” cried Holmes, in a sharp tone, and the six dirty little\nscoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes. “In\nfuture you shall send up Wiggins alone to report, and the rest of you\nmust wait in the street. Have you found it, Wiggins?”\n\n“No, sir, we hain’t,” said one of the youths.\n\n“I hardly expected you would. You must keep on until you do. Here are\nyour wages.” He handed each of them a shilling.\n\n“Now, off you go, and come back with a better report next time.”\n\nHe waved his hand, and they scampered away downstairs like so many\nrats, and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street.\n\n“There’s more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than\nout of a dozen of the force,” Holmes remarked. “The mere sight of an\nofficial-looking person seals men’s lips. These youngsters, however, go\neverywhere and hear everything. They are as sharp as needles, too; all\nthey want is organisation.”",
      "“Is it on this Brixton case that you are employing them?” I asked.\n\n“Yes; there is a point which I wish to ascertain. It is merely a matter\nof time. Hullo! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance!\nHere is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every\nfeature of his face. Bound for us, I know. Yes, he is stopping. There\nhe is!”\n\nThere was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds the\nfair-haired detective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and\nburst into our sitting-room.\n\n“My dear fellow,” he cried, wringing Holmes’ unresponsive hand,\n“congratulate me! I have made the whole thing as clear as day.”\n\nA shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion’s expressive\nface.\n\n“Do you mean that you are on the right track?” he asked.\n\n“The right track! Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key.”\n\n“And his name is?”\n\n“Arthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty’s navy,” cried\nGregson, pompously, rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest.\n\nSherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief, and relaxed into a smile.\n\n“Take a seat, and try one of these cigars,” he said. “We are anxious to\nknow how you managed it. Will you have some whiskey and water?”",
      "“I don’t mind if I do,” the detective answered. “The tremendous\nexertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have\nworn me out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain\nupon the mind. You will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we\nare both brain-workers.”\n\n“You do me too much honour,” said Holmes, gravely. “Let us hear how you\narrived at this most gratifying result.”\n\nThe detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed complacently\nat his cigar. Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of\namusement.\n\n“The fun of it is,” he cried, “that that fool Lestrade, who thinks\nhimself so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. He is\nafter the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime\nthan the babe unborn. I have no doubt that he has caught him by this\ntime.”\n\nThe idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked.\n\n“And how did you get your clue?”\n\n“Ah, I’ll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor Watson, this is\nstrictly between ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to\ncontend with was the finding of this American’s antecedents. Some\npeople would have waited until their advertisements were answered, or\nuntil parties came forward and volunteered information. That is not\nTobias Gregson’s way of going to work. You remember the hat beside the\ndead man?”",
      "“Yes,” said Holmes; “by John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road.”\n\nGregson looked quite crest-fallen.\n\n“I had no idea that you noticed that,” he said. “Have you been there?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Ha!” cried Gregson, in a relieved voice; “you should never neglect a\nchance, however small it may seem.”\n\n“To a great mind, nothing is little,” remarked Holmes, sententiously.\n\n“Well, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of that\nsize and description. He looked over his books, and came on it at once.\nHe had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at Charpentier’s\nBoarding Establishment, Torquay Terrace. Thus I got at his address.”\n\n“Smart—very smart!” murmured Sherlock Holmes.\n\n“I next called upon Madame Charpentier,” continued the detective. “I\nfound her very pale and distressed. Her daughter was in the room,\ntoo—an uncommonly fine girl she is, too; she was looking red about the\neyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her. That didn’t escape my\nnotice. I began to smell a rat. You know the feeling, Mr. Sherlock\nHolmes, when you come upon the right scent—a kind of thrill in your\nnerves. ‘Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder\nMr. Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland?’ I asked.\n\n“The mother nodded. She didn’t seem able to get out a word. The\ndaughter burst into tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew\nsomething of the matter.",
      "“‘At what o’clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?’ I\nasked.\n\n“‘At eight o’clock,’ she said, gulping in her throat to keep down her\nagitation. ‘His secretary, Mr. Stangerson, said that there were two\ntrains—one at 9.15 and one at 11. He was to catch the first.’\n\n“‘And was that the last which you saw of him?’\n\n“A terrible change came over the woman’s face as I asked the question.\nHer features turned perfectly livid. It was some seconds before she\ncould get out the single word ‘Yes’—and when it did come it was in a\nhusky unnatural tone.\n\n“There was silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a calm\nclear voice.\n\n“‘No good can ever come of falsehood, mother,’ she said. ‘Let us be\nfrank with this gentleman. We _did_ see Mr. Drebber again.’\n\n“‘God forgive you!’ cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her hands and\nsinking back in her chair. ‘You have murdered your brother.’\n\n“‘Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth,’ the girl answered\nfirmly.\n\n“‘You had best tell me all about it now,’ I said. ‘Half-confidences are\nworse than none. Besides, you do not know how much we know of it.’",
      "“‘On your head be it, Alice!’ cried her mother; and then, turning to\nme, ‘I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on\nbehalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in\nthis terrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is,\nhowever, that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to\nbe compromised. That however is surely impossible. His high character,\nhis profession, his antecedents would all forbid it.’\n\n“‘Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,’ I answered.\n‘Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.’\n\n“‘Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,’ she said, and her\ndaughter withdrew. ‘Now, sir,’ she continued, ‘I had no intention of\ntelling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I\nhave no alternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you all\nwithout omitting any particular.’\n\n“‘It is your wisest course,’ said I.",
      "“‘Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his\nsecretary, Mr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I\nnoticed a “Copenhagen” label upon each of their trunks, showing that\nthat had been their last stopping place. Stangerson was a quiet\nreserved man, but his employer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise.\nHe was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways. The very night of\nhis arrival he became very much the worse for drink, and, indeed, after\ntwelve o’clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be sober. His\nmanners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly free and familiar.\nWorst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude towards my\ndaughter, Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way which,\nfortunately, she is too innocent to understand. On one occasion he\nactually seized her in his arms and embraced her—an outrage which\ncaused his own secretary to reproach him for his unmanly conduct.’\n\n“‘But why did you stand all this?’ I asked. ‘I suppose that you can get\nrid of your boarders when you wish.’",
      "“Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. ‘Would to God that\nI had given him notice on the very day that he came,’ she said. ‘But it\nwas a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day each—fourteen\npounds a week, and this is the slack season. I am a widow, and my boy\nin the Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose the money. I acted for\nthe best. This last was too much, however, and I gave him notice to\nleave on account of it. That was the reason of his going.’\n\n“‘Well?’",
      "“‘My heart grew light when I saw him drive away. My son is on leave\njust now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper\nis violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister. When I closed\nthe door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas, in\nless than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that Mr.\nDrebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the worse for\ndrink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting with my\ndaughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed his\ntrain. He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to\nher that she should fly with him. “You are of age,” he said, “and there\nis no law to stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never mind the\nold girl here, but come along with me now straight away. You shall live\nlike a princess.” Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away\nfrom him, but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her\ntowards the door. I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came\ninto the room. What happened then I do not know. I heard oaths and the\nconfused sounds of a scuffle. I was too terrified to raise my head.\nWhen I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with\na stick in his hand. “I don’t think that fine fellow will trouble us\nagain,” he said. “I will just go after him and see what he does with\nhimself.” With those words he took his hat and started off down the\nstreet. The next morning we heard of Mr. Drebber’s mysterious death.’",
      "“This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier’s lips with many gasps and\npauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words.\nI made shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that there\nshould be no possibility of a mistake.”\n\n“It’s quite exciting,” said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. “What\nhappened next?”\n\n“When Mrs. Charpentier paused,” the detective continued, “I saw that\nthe whole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way\nwhich I always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour her\nson returned.\n\n“‘I do not know,’ she answered.\n\n“‘Not know?’\n\n“‘No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in.’\n\n“‘After you went to bed?’\n\n“‘Yes.’\n\n“‘When did you go to bed?’\n\n“‘About eleven.’\n\n“‘So your son was gone at least two hours?’\n\n“‘Yes.’\n\n“‘Possibly four or five?’\n\n“‘Yes.’\n\n“‘What was he doing during that time?’\n\n“‘I do not know,’ she answered, turning white to her very lips.\n\n“Of course after that there was nothing more to be done. I found out\nwhere Lieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, and\narrested him. When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come\nquietly with us, he answered us as bold as brass, ‘I suppose you are\narresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel\nDrebber,’ he said. We had said nothing to him about it, so that his\nalluding to it had a most suspicious aspect.”",
      "“Very,” said Holmes.\n\n“He still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as\nhaving with him when he followed Drebber. It was a stout oak cudgel.”\n\n“What is your theory, then?”\n\n“Well, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton\nRoad. When there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course\nof which Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the\nstomach, perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. The night\nwas so wet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of\nhis victim into the empty house. As to the candle, and the blood, and\nthe writing on the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks\nto throw the police on to the wrong scent.”\n\n“Well done!” said Holmes in an encouraging voice. “Really, Gregson, you\nare getting along. We shall make something of you yet.”",
      "“I flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly,” the detective\nanswered proudly. “The young man volunteered a statement, in which he\nsaid that after following Drebber some time, the latter perceived him,\nand took a cab in order to get away from him. On his way home he met an\nold shipmate, and took a long walk with him. On being asked where this\nold shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply. I\nthink the whole case fits together uncommonly well. What amuses me is\nto think of Lestrade, who had started off upon the wrong scent. I am\nafraid he won’t make much of it. Why, by Jove, here’s the very man\nhimself!”\n\nIt was indeed Lestrade, who had ascended the stairs while we were\ntalking, and who now entered the room. The assurance and jauntiness\nwhich generally marked his demeanour and dress were, however, wanting.\nHis face was disturbed and troubled, while his clothes were disarranged\nand untidy. He had evidently come with the intention of consulting with\nSherlock Holmes, for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be\nembarrassed and put out. He stood in the centre of the room, fumbling\nnervously with his hat and uncertain what to do. “This is a most\nextraordinary case,” he said at last—“a most incomprehensible affair.”",
      "“Ah, you find it so, Mr. Lestrade!” cried Gregson, triumphantly. “I\nthought you would come to that conclusion. Have you managed to find the\nSecretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson?”\n\n“The Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson,” said Lestrade gravely, “was\nmurdered at Halliday’s Private Hotel about six o’clock this morning.”\n\nCHAPTER VII.\nLIGHT IN THE DARKNESS.\n\nThe intelligence with which Lestrade greeted us was so momentous and so\nunexpected, that we were all three fairly dumfoundered. Gregson sprang\nout of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water. I\nstared in silence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and\nhis brows drawn down over his eyes.\n\n“Stangerson too!” he muttered. “The plot thickens.”\n\n“It was quite thick enough before,” grumbled Lestrade, taking a chair.\n“I seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war.”\n\n“Are you—are you sure of this piece of intelligence?” stammered\nGregson.\n\n“I have just come from his room,” said Lestrade. “I was the first to\ndiscover what had occurred.”\n\n“We have been hearing Gregson’s view of the matter,” Holmes observed.\n“Would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done?”",
      "“I have no objection,” Lestrade answered, seating himself. “I freely\nconfess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in the\ndeath of Drebber. This fresh development has shown me that I was\ncompletely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out\nwhat had become of the Secretary. They had been seen together at Euston\nStation about half-past eight on the evening of the third. At two in\nthe morning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road. The question\nwhich confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed\nbetween 8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him\nafterwards. I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the\nman, and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats. I then\nset to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the\nvicinity of Euston. You see, I argued that if Drebber and his companion\nhad become separated, the natural course for the latter would be to put\nup somewhere in the vicinity for the night, and then to hang about the\nstation again next morning.”\n\n“They would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand,”\nremarked Holmes.",
      "“So it proved. I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making\nenquiries entirely without avail. This morning I began very early, and\nat eight o’clock I reached Halliday’s Private Hotel, in Little George\nStreet. On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there,\nthey at once answered me in the affirmative.\n\n“‘No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,’ they said. ‘He\nhas been waiting for a gentleman for two days.’\n\n“‘Where is he now?’ I asked.\n\n“‘He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine.’\n\n“‘I will go up and see him at once,’ I said.",
      "“It seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and\nlead him to say something unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show me\nthe room: it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor\nleading up to it. The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about\nto go downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish,\nin spite of my twenty years’ experience. From under the door there\ncurled a little red ribbon of blood, which had meandered across the\npassage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side.\nI gave a cry, which brought the Boots back. He nearly fainted when he\nsaw it. The door was locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to\nit, and knocked it in. The window of the room was open, and beside the\nwindow, all huddled up, lay the body of a man in his nightdress. He was\nquite dead, and had been for some time, for his limbs were rigid and\ncold. When we turned him over, the Boots recognized him at once as\nbeing the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of\nJoseph Stangerson. The cause of death was a deep stab in the left side,\nwhich must have penetrated the heart. And now comes the strangest part\nof the affair. What do you suppose was above the murdered man?”\n\nI felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror,\neven before Sherlock Holmes answered.",
      "“The word RACHE, written in letters of blood,” he said.\n\n“That was it,” said Lestrade, in an awe-struck voice; and we were all\nsilent for a while.\n\nThere was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the\ndeeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to\nhis crimes. My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle\ntingled as I thought of it.\n\n“The man was seen,” continued Lestrade. “A milk boy, passing on his way\nto the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews\nat the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay\nthere, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which\nwas wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the\nladder. He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to\nbe some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. He took no particular\nnotice of him, beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for\nhim to be at work. He has an impression that the man was tall, had a\nreddish face, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat. He must have\nstayed in the room some little time after the murder, for we found\nblood-stained water in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and\nmarks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.”",
      "I glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, which\ntallied so exactly with his own. There was, however, no trace of\nexultation or satisfaction upon his face.\n\n“Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the\nmurderer?” he asked.\n\n“Nothing. Stangerson had Drebber’s purse in his pocket, but it seems\nthat this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd\npounds in it, but nothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of these\nextraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them. There were\nno papers or memoranda in the murdered man’s pocket, except a single\ntelegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containing the\nwords, ‘J. H. is in Europe.’ There was no name appended to this\nmessage.”\n\n“And there was nothing else?” Holmes asked.\n\n“Nothing of any importance. The man’s novel, with which he had read\nhimself to sleep was lying upon the bed, and his pipe was on a chair\nbeside him. There was a glass of water on the table, and on the\nwindow-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills.”\n\nSherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight.\n\n“The last link,” he cried, exultantly. “My case is complete.”\n\nThe two detectives stared at him in amazement.",
      "“I have now in my hands,” my companion said, confidently, “all the\nthreads which have formed such a tangle. There are, of course, details\nto be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts, from the\ntime that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station, up to the\ndiscovery of the body of the latter, as if I had seen them with my own\neyes. I will give you a proof of my knowledge. Could you lay your hand\nupon those pills?”\n\n“I have them,” said Lestrade, producing a small white box; “I took them\nand the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place\nof safety at the Police Station. It was the merest chance my taking\nthese pills, for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance\nto them.”\n\n“Give them here,” said Holmes. “Now, Doctor,” turning to me, “are those\nordinary pills?”\n\nThey certainly were not. They were of a pearly grey colour, small,\nround, and almost transparent against the light. “From their lightness\nand transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water,” I\nremarked.\n\n“Precisely so,” answered Holmes. “Now would you mind going down and\nfetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so\nlong, and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain\nyesterday.”",
      "I went downstairs and carried the dog upstairs in my arms. Its laboured\nbreathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end.\nIndeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded\nthe usual term of canine existence. I placed it upon a cushion on the\nrug.\n\n“I will now cut one of these pills in two,” said Holmes, and drawing\nhis penknife he suited the action to the word. “One half we return into\nthe box for future purposes. The other half I will place in this wine\nglass, in which is a teaspoonful of water. You perceive that our\nfriend, the Doctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves.”\n\n“This may be very interesting,” said Lestrade, in the injured tone of\none who suspects that he is being laughed at, “I cannot see, however,\nwhat it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.”\n\n“Patience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it has\neverything to do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the\nmixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps\nit up readily enough.”",
      "As he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and\nplaced it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry. Sherlock\nHolmes’ earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in\nsilence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some startling\neffect. None such appeared, however. The dog continued to lie stretched\nupon the cushion, breathing in a laboured way, but apparently neither\nthe better nor the worse for its draught.\n\nHolmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without\nresult, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared\nupon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the\ntable, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience. So great was\nhis emotion, that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while the two\ndetectives smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this check\nwhich he had met.",
      "“It can’t be a coincidence,” he cried, at last springing from his chair\nand pacing wildly up and down the room; “it is impossible that it\nshould be a mere coincidence. The very pills which I suspected in the\ncase of Drebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson. And\nyet they are inert. What can it mean? Surely my whole chain of\nreasoning cannot have been false. It is impossible! And yet this\nwretched dog is none the worse. Ah, I have it! I have it!” With a\nperfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box, cut the other pill in\ntwo, dissolved it, added milk, and presented it to the terrier. The\nunfortunate creature’s tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in\nit before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb, and lay as rigid\nand lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning.\n\nSherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from his\nforehead. “I should have more faith,” he said; “I ought to know by this\ntime that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of\ndeductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other\ninterpretation. Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly\npoison, and the other was entirely harmless. I ought to have known that\nbefore ever I saw the box at all.”",
      "This last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could\nhardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead dog,\nhowever, to prove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to me\nthat the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began\nto have a dim, vague perception of the truth.\n\n“All this seems strange to you,” continued Holmes, “because you failed\nat the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single\nreal clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune to seize\nupon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to\nconfirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence\nof it. Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more\nobscure, have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions.\nIt is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most\ncommonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no\nnew or special features from which deductions may be drawn. This murder\nwould have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of\nthe victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those\n_outré_ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it\nremarkable. These strange details, far from making the case more\ndifficult, have really had the effect of making it less so.”",
      "Mr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable\nimpatience, could contain himself no longer. “Look here, Mr. Sherlock\nHolmes,” he said, “we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart\nman, and that you have your own methods of working. We want something\nmore than mere theory and preaching now, though. It is a case of taking\nthe man. I have made my case out, and it seems I was wrong. Young\nCharpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair. Lestrade\nwent after his man, Stangerson, and it appears that he was wrong too.\nYou have thrown out hints here, and hints there, and seem to know more\nthan we do, but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to\nask you straight how much you do know of the business. Can you name the\nman who did it?”\n\n“I cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir,” remarked Lestrade.\n“We have both tried, and we have both failed. You have remarked more\nthan once since I have been in the room that you had all the evidence\nwhich you require. Surely you will not withhold it any longer.”\n\n“Any delay in arresting the assassin,” I observed, “might give him time\nto perpetrate some fresh atrocity.”\n\nThus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. He\ncontinued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest\nand his brows drawn down, as was his habit when lost in thought.",
      "“There will be no more murders,” he said at last, stopping abruptly and\nfacing us. “You can put that consideration out of the question. You\nhave asked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere\nknowing of his name is a small thing, however, compared with the power\nof laying our hands upon him. This I expect very shortly to do. I have\ngood hopes of managing it through my own arrangements; but it is a\nthing which needs delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and desperate\nman to deal with, who is supported, as I have had occasion to prove, by\nanother who is as clever as himself. As long as this man has no idea\nthat anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him; but\nif he had the slightest suspicion, he would change his name, and vanish\nin an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city.\nWithout meaning to hurt either of your feelings, I am bound to say that\nI consider these men to be more than a match for the official force,\nand that is why I have not asked your assistance. If I fail I shall, of\ncourse, incur all the blame due to this omission; but that I am\nprepared for. At present I am ready to promise that the instant that I\ncan communicate with you without endangering my own combinations, I\nshall do so.”",
      "Gregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance,\nor by the depreciating allusion to the detective police. The former had\nflushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair, while the other’s beady\neyes glistened with curiosity and resentment. Neither of them had time\nto speak, however, before there was a tap at the door, and the\nspokesman of the street Arabs, young Wiggins, introduced his\ninsignificant and unsavoury person.\n\n“Please, sir,” he said, touching his forelock, “I have the cab\ndownstairs.”\n\n“Good boy,” said Holmes, blandly. “Why don’t you introduce this pattern\nat Scotland Yard?” he continued, taking a pair of steel handcuffs from\na drawer. “See how beautifully the spring works. They fasten in an\ninstant.”\n\n“The old pattern is good enough,” remarked Lestrade, “if we can only\nfind the man to put them on.”\n\n“Very good, very good,” said Holmes, smiling. “The cabman may as well\nhelp me with my boxes. Just ask him to step up, Wiggins.”\n\nI was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about\nto set out on a journey, since he had not said anything to me about it.\nThere was a small portmanteau in the room, and this he pulled out and\nbegan to strap. He was busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the\nroom.\n\n“Just give me a help with this buckle, cabman,” he said, kneeling over\nhis task, and never turning his head.",
      "The fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen, defiant air, and put\ndown his hands to assist. At that instant there was a sharp click, the\njangling of metal, and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again.\n\n“Gentlemen,” he cried, with flashing eyes, “let me introduce you to Mr.\nJefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph\nStangerson.”",
      "The whole thing occurred in a moment—so quickly that I had no time to\nrealize it. I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of Holmes’\ntriumphant expression and the ring of his voice, of the cabman’s dazed,\nsavage face, as he glared at the glittering handcuffs, which had\nappeared as if by magic upon his wrists. For a second or two we might\nhave been a group of statues. Then, with an inarticulate roar of fury,\nthe prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes’s grasp, and hurled\nhimself through the window. Woodwork and glass gave way before him; but\nbefore he got quite through, Gregson, Lestrade, and Holmes sprang upon\nhim like so many staghounds. He was dragged back into the room, and\nthen commenced a terrific conflict. So powerful and so fierce was he,\nthat the four of us were shaken off again and again. He appeared to\nhave the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. His face and\nhands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass, but loss\nof blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance. It was not until\nLestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and\nhalf-strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of\nno avail; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his\nfeet as well as his hands. That done, we rose to our feet breathless\nand panting.",
      "“We have his cab,” said Sherlock Holmes. “It will serve to take him to\nScotland Yard. And now, gentlemen,” he continued, with a pleasant\nsmile, “we have reached the end of our little mystery. You are very\nwelcome to put any questions that you like to me now, and there is no\ndanger that I will refuse to answer them.”\n\nPART II.\n_The Country of the Saints._\n\nCHAPTER I.\nON THE GREAT ALKALI PLAIN.\n\nIn the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies\nan arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a\nbarrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra Nevada to\nNebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado\nupon the south, is a region of desolation and silence. Nor is Nature\nalways in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprises\nsnow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are\nswift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged cañons; and there are\nenormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are\ngrey with the saline alkali dust. They all preserve, however, the\ncommon characteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery.",
      "There are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees or\nof Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other\nhunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight\nof those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon their\nprairies. The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily\nthrough the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark\nravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks.\nThese are the sole dwellers in the wilderness.\n\nIn the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the\nnorthern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach\nstretches the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of\nalkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes. On\nthe extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks,\nwith their rugged summits flecked with snow. In this great stretch of\ncountry there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life.\nThere is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull,\ngrey earth—above all, there is absolute silence. Listen as one may,\nthere is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing\nbut silence—complete and heart-subduing silence.",
      "It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad\nplain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one\nsees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is\nlost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down\nby the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scattered\nwhite objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull\ndeposit of alkali. Approach, and examine them! They are bones: some\nlarge and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have\nbelonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one\nmay trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of\nthose who had fallen by the wayside.",
      "Looking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May,\neighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His appearance\nwas such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the\nregion. An observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was\nnearer to forty or to sixty. His face was lean and haggard, and the\nbrown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones;\nhis long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white;\nhis eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre;\nwhile the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that\nof a skeleton. As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support, and\nyet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a\nwiry and vigorous constitution. His gaunt face, however, and his\nclothes, which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed\nwhat it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance. The man\nwas dying—dying from hunger and from thirst.",
      "He had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little\nelevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the\ngreat salt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of\nsavage mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might\nindicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape there\nwas no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with wild\nquestioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings had come to\nan end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die. “Why\nnot here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,” he\nmuttered, as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.\n\nBefore sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless\nrifle, and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had\ncarried slung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too\nheavy for his strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the ground\nwith some little violence. Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a\nlittle moaning cry, and from it there protruded a small, scared face,\nwith very bright brown eyes, and two little speckled, dimpled fists.\n\n“You’ve hurt me!” said a childish voice reproachfully.",
      "“Have I though,” the man answered penitently, “I didn’t go for to do\nit.” As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty\nlittle girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart\npink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother’s care. The\nchild was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that she\nhad suffered less than her companion.\n\n“How is it now?” he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing the\ntowsy golden curls which covered the back of her head.\n\n“Kiss it and make it well,” she said, with perfect gravity, showing the\ninjured part up to him. “That’s what mother used to do. Where’s\nmother?”\n\n“Mother’s gone. I guess you’ll see her before long.”\n\n“Gone, eh!” said the little girl. “Funny, she didn’t say good-bye; she\n‘most always did if she was just goin’ over to Auntie’s for tea, and\nnow she’s been away three days. Say, it’s awful dry, ain’t it? Ain’t\nthere no water, nor nothing to eat?”\n\n“No, there ain’t nothing, dearie. You’ll just need to be patient\nawhile, and then you’ll be all right. Put your head up agin me like\nthat, and then you’ll feel bullier. It ain’t easy to talk when your\nlips is like leather, but I guess I’d best let you know how the cards\nlie. What’s that you’ve got?”",
      "“Pretty things! fine things!” cried the little girl enthusiastically,\nholding up two glittering fragments of mica. “When we goes back to home\nI’ll give them to brother Bob.”\n\n“You’ll see prettier things than them soon,” said the man confidently.\n“You just wait a bit. I was going to tell you though—you remember when\nwe left the river?”\n\n“Oh, yes.”\n\n“Well, we reckoned we’d strike another river soon, d’ye see. But there\nwas somethin’ wrong; compasses, or map, or somethin’, and it didn’t\nturn up. Water ran out. Just except a little drop for the likes of you\nand—and——”\n\n“And you couldn’t wash yourself,” interrupted his companion gravely,\nstaring up at his grimy visage.\n\n“No, nor drink. And Mr. Bender, he was the fust to go, and then Indian\nPete, and then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then, dearie,\nyour mother.”\n\n“Then mother’s a deader too,” cried the little girl dropping her face\nin her pinafore and sobbing bitterly.\n\n“Yes, they all went except you and me. Then I thought there was some\nchance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and\nwe tramped it together. It don’t seem as though we’ve improved matters.\nThere’s an almighty small chance for us now!”\n\n“Do you mean that we are going to die too?” asked the child, checking\nher sobs, and raising her tear-stained face.\n\n“I guess that’s about the size of it.”",
      "“Why didn’t you say so before?” she said, laughing gleefully. “You gave\nme such a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we’ll be with\nmother again.”\n\n“Yes, you will, dearie.”\n\n“And you too. I’ll tell her how awful good you’ve been. I’ll bet she\nmeets us at the door of Heaven with a big pitcher of water, and a lot\nof buckwheat cakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me was\nfond of. How long will it be first?”\n\n“I don’t know—not very long.” The man’s eyes were fixed upon the\nnorthern horizon. In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared\nthree little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly\ndid they approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large\nbrown birds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and\nthen settled upon some rocks which overlooked them. They were buzzards,\nthe vultures of the west, whose coming is the forerunner of death.\n\n“Cocks and hens,” cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their\nill-omened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise. “Say, did\nGod make this country?”\n\n“In course He did,” said her companion, rather startled by this\nunexpected question.\n\n“He made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri,” the\nlittle girl continued. “I guess somebody else made the country in these\nparts. It’s not nearly so well done. They forgot the water and the\ntrees.”",
      "“What would ye think of offering up prayer?” the man asked diffidently.\n\n“It ain’t night yet,” she answered.\n\n“It don’t matter. It ain’t quite regular, but He won’t mind that, you\nbet. You say over them ones that you used to say every night in the\nwaggon when we was on the Plains.”\n\n“Why don’t you say some yourself?” the child asked, with wondering\neyes.\n\n“I disremember them,” he answered. “I hain’t said none since I was half\nthe height o’ that gun. I guess it’s never too late. You say them out,\nand I’ll stand by and come in on the choruses.”\n\n“Then you’ll need to kneel down, and me too,” she said, laying the\nshawl out for that purpose. “You’ve got to put your hands up like this.\nIt makes you feel kind o’ good.”",
      "It was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to see\nit. Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the\nlittle prattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her\nchubby face, and his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to the\ncloudless heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom\nthey were face to face, while the two voices—the one thin and clear,\nthe other deep and harsh—united in the entreaty for mercy and\nforgiveness. The prayer finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow\nof the boulder until the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad\nbreast of her protector. He watched over her slumber for some time, but\nNature proved to be too strong for him. For three days and three nights\nhe had allowed himself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids\ndrooped over the tired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the\nbreast, until the man’s grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses\nof his companion, and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber.",
      "Had the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight\nwould have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali\nplain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and\nhardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but\ngradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid,\nwell-defined cloud. This cloud continued to increase in size until it\nbecame evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of\nmoving creatures. In more fertile spots the observer would have come to\nthe conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze upon\nthe prairie land was approaching him. This was obviously impossible in\nthese arid wilds. As the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary\nbluff upon which the two castaways were reposing, the canvas-covered\ntilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up\nthrough the haze, and the apparition revealed itself as being a great\ncaravan upon its journey for the West. But what a caravan! When the\nhead of it had reached the base of the mountains, the rear was not yet\nvisible on the horizon. Right across the enormous plain stretched the\nstraggling array, waggons and carts, men on horseback, and men on foot.\nInnumerable women who staggered along under burdens, and children who\ntoddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white\ncoverings. This was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants, but\nrather some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of\ncircumstances to seek themselves a new country. There rose through the\nclear air a confused clattering and rumbling from this great mass of\nhumanity, with the creaking of wheels and the neighing of horses. Loud\nas it was, it was not sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarers above\nthem.",
      "At the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced\nmen, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles. On\nreaching the base of the bluff they halted, and held a short council\namong themselves.\n\n“The wells are to the right, my brothers,” said one, a hard-lipped,\nclean-shaven man with grizzly hair.\n\n“To the right of the Sierra Blanco—so we shall reach the Rio Grande,”\nsaid another.\n\n“Fear not for water,” cried a third. “He who could draw it from the\nrocks will not now abandon His own chosen people.”\n\n“Amen! Amen!” responded the whole party.\n\nThey were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and\nkeenest-eyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag\nabove them. From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink,\nshowing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind. At the sight\nthere was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns, while\nfresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard. The word\n“Redskins” was on every lip.\n\n“There can’t be any number of Injuns here,” said the elderly man who\nappeared to be in command. “We have passed the Pawnees, and there are\nno other tribes until we cross the great mountains.”\n\n“Shall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson,” asked one of the\nband.\n\n“And I,” “and I,” cried a dozen voices.",
      "“Leave your horses below and we will await you here,” the Elder\nanswered. In a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their\nhorses, and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the\nobject which had excited their curiosity. They advanced rapidly and\nnoiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts. The\nwatchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock\nuntil their figures stood out against the skyline. The young man who\nhad first given the alarm was leading them. Suddenly his followers saw\nhim throw up his hands, as though overcome with astonishment, and on\njoining him they were affected in the same way by the sight which met\ntheir eyes.",
      "On the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a\nsingle giant boulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man,\nlong-bearded and hard-featured, but of an excessive thinness. His\nplacid face and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep.\nBeside him lay a little child, with her round white arms encircling his\nbrown sinewy neck, and her golden haired head resting upon the breast\nof his velveteen tunic. Her rosy lips were parted, showing the regular\nline of snow-white teeth within, and a playful smile played over her\ninfantile features. Her plump little white legs terminating in white\nsocks and neat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange contrast\nto the long shrivelled members of her companion. On the ledge of rock\nabove this strange couple there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at\nthe sight of the new comers uttered raucous screams of disappointment\nand flapped sullenly away.",
      "The cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about\nthem in bewilderment. The man staggered to his feet and looked down\nupon the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him,\nand which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts.\nHis face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed, and he\npassed his boney hand over his eyes. “This is what they call delirium,\nI guess,” he muttered. The child stood beside him, holding on to the\nskirt of his coat, and said nothing but looked all round her with the\nwondering questioning gaze of childhood.\n\nThe rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways\nthat their appearance was no delusion. One of them seized the little\ngirl, and hoisted her upon his shoulder, while two others supported her\ngaunt companion, and assisted him towards the waggons.\n\n“My name is John Ferrier,” the wanderer explained; “me and that little\nun are all that’s left o’ twenty-one people. The rest is all dead o’\nthirst and hunger away down in the south.”\n\n“Is she your child?” asked someone.\n\n“I guess she is now,” the other cried, defiantly; “she’s mine ’cause I\nsaved her. No man will take her from me. She’s Lucy Ferrier from this\nday on. Who are you, though?” he continued, glancing with curiosity at\nhis stalwart, sunburned rescuers; “there seems to be a powerful lot of\nye.”",
      "“Nigh upon ten thousand,” said one of the young men; “we are the\npersecuted children of God—the chosen of the Angel Merona.”\n\n“I never heard tell on him,” said the wanderer. “He appears to have\nchosen a fair crowd of ye.”\n\n“Do not jest at that which is sacred,” said the other sternly. “We are\nof those who believe in those sacred writings, drawn in Egyptian\nletters on plates of beaten gold, which were handed unto the holy\nJoseph Smith at Palmyra. We have come from Nauvoo, in the State of\nIllinois, where we had founded our temple. We have come to seek a\nrefuge from the violent man and from the godless, even though it be the\nheart of the desert.”\n\nThe name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to John Ferrier. “I\nsee,” he said, “you are the Mormons.”\n\n“We are the Mormons,” answered his companions with one voice.\n\n“And where are you going?”\n\n“We do not know. The hand of God is leading us under the person of our\nProphet. You must come before him. He shall say what is to be done with\nyou.”",
      "They had reached the base of the hill by this time, and were surrounded\nby crowds of the pilgrims—pale-faced meek-looking women, strong\nlaughing children, and anxious earnest-eyed men. Many were the cries of\nastonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they\nperceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the\nother. Their escort did not halt, however, but pushed on, followed by a\ngreat crowd of Mormons, until they reached a waggon, which was\nconspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of\nits appearance. Six horses were yoked to it, whereas the others were\nfurnished with two, or, at most, four a-piece. Beside the driver there\nsat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age, but\nwhose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader. He\nwas reading a brown-backed volume, but as the crowd approached he laid\nit aside, and listened attentively to an account of the episode. Then\nhe turned to the two castaways.\n\n“If we take you with us,” he said, in solemn words, “it can only be as\nbelievers in our own creed. We shall have no wolves in our fold. Better\nfar that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you\nshould prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts\nthe whole fruit. Will you come with us on these terms?”",
      "“Guess I’ll come with you on any terms,” said Ferrier, with such\nemphasis that the grave Elders could not restrain a smile. The leader\nalone retained his stern, impressive expression.\n\n“Take him, Brother Stangerson,” he said, “give him food and drink, and\nthe child likewise. Let it be your task also to teach him our holy\ncreed. We have delayed long enough. Forward! On, on to Zion!”\n\n“On, on to Zion!” cried the crowd of Mormons, and the words rippled\ndown the long caravan, passing from mouth to mouth until they died away\nin a dull murmur in the far distance. With a cracking of whips and a\ncreaking of wheels the great waggons got into motion, and soon the\nwhole caravan was winding along once more. The Elder to whose care the\ntwo waifs had been committed, led them to his waggon, where a meal was\nalready awaiting them.\n\n“You shall remain here,” he said. “In a few days you will have\nrecovered from your fatigues. In the meantime, remember that now and\nfor ever you are of our religion. Brigham Young has said it, and he has\nspoken with the voice of Joseph Smith, which is the voice of God.”\n\nCHAPTER II.\nTHE FLOWER OF UTAH.",
      "This is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured\nby the immigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven. From\nthe shores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky\nMountains they had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in\nhistory. The savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue,\nand disease—every impediment which Nature could place in the way, had\nall been overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity. Yet the long journey and\nthe accumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among\nthem. There was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt\nprayer when they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight\nbeneath them, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was\nthe promised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for\nevermore.",
      "Young speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as\na resolute chief. Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which the\nfuture city was sketched out. All around farms were apportioned and\nallotted in proportion to the standing of each individual. The\ntradesman was put to his trade and the artisan to his calling. In the\ntown streets and squares sprang up, as if by magic. In the country\nthere was draining and hedging, planting and clearing, until the next\nsummer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop. Everything\nprospered in the strange settlement. Above all, the great temple which\nthey had erected in the centre of the city grew ever taller and larger.\nFrom the first blush of dawn until the closing of the twilight, the\nclatter of the hammer and the rasp of the saw was never absent from the\nmonument which the immigrants erected to Him who had led them safe\nthrough many dangers.",
      "The two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his\nfortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormons\nto the end of their great pilgrimage. Little Lucy Ferrier was borne\nalong pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson’s waggon, a retreat which\nshe shared with the Mormon’s three wives and with his son, a headstrong\nforward boy of twelve. Having rallied, with the elasticity of\nchildhood, from the shock caused by her mother’s death, she soon became\na pet with the women, and reconciled herself to this new life in her\nmoving canvas-covered home. In the meantime Ferrier having recovered\nfrom his privations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an\nindefatigable hunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new\ncompanions, that when they reached the end of their wanderings, it was\nunanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as\nfertile a tract of land as any of the settlers, with the exception of\nYoung himself, and of Stangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who\nwere the four principal Elders.",
      "On the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial\nlog-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it\ngrew into a roomy villa. He was a man of a practical turn of mind, keen\nin his dealings and skilful with his hands. His iron constitution\nenabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his\nlands. Hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to him\nprospered exceedingly. In three years he was better off than his\nneighbours, in six he was well-to-do, in nine he was rich, and in\ntwelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City\nwho could compare with him. From the great inland sea to the distant\nWahsatch Mountains there was no name better known than that of John\nFerrier.",
      "There was one way and only one in which he offended the\nsusceptibilities of his co-religionists. No argument or persuasion\ncould ever induce him to set up a female establishment after the manner\nof his companions. He never gave reasons for this persistent refusal,\nbut contented himself by resolutely and inflexibly adhering to his\ndetermination. There were some who accused him of lukewarmness in his\nadopted religion, and others who put it down to greed of wealth and\nreluctance to incur expense. Others, again, spoke of some early love\naffair, and of a fair-haired girl who had pined away on the shores of\nthe Atlantic. Whatever the reason, Ferrier remained strictly celibate.\nIn every other respect he conformed to the religion of the young\nsettlement, and gained the name of being an orthodox and\nstraight-walking man.",
      "Lucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted her adopted\nfather in all his undertakings. The keen air of the mountains and the\nbalsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to\nthe young girl. As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger,\nher cheek more ruddy, and her step more elastic. Many a wayfarer upon\nthe high road which ran by Ferrier’s farm felt long-forgotten thoughts\nrevive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping\nthrough the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father’s mustang,\nand managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the\nWest. So the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw her\nfather the richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of\nAmerican girlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope.",
      "It was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had\ndeveloped into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That mysterious\nchange is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. Least of\nall does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the\ntouch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns,\nwith a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature has\nawoken within her. There are few who cannot recall that day and\nremember the one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life.\nIn the case of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself,\napart from its future influence on her destiny and that of many\nbesides.",
      "It was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as\nthe bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem. In the fields\nand in the streets rose the same hum of human industry. Down the dusty\nhigh roads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to\nthe west, for the gold fever had broken out in California, and the\nOverland Route lay through the City of the Elect. There, too, were\ndroves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands,\nand trains of tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary of their\ninterminable journey. Through all this motley assemblage, threading her\nway with the skill of an accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy\nFerrier, her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut\nhair floating out behind her. She had a commission from her father in\nthe City, and was dashing in as she had done many a time before, with\nall the fearlessness of youth, thinking only of her task and how it was\nto be performed. The travel-stained adventurers gazed after her in\nastonishment, and even the unemotional Indians, journeying in with\ntheir pelties, relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at\nthe beauty of the pale-faced maiden.",
      "She had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road\nblocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking\nherdsmen from the plains. In her impatience she endeavoured to pass\nthis obstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap.\nScarcely had she got fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed\nin behind her, and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving\nstream of fierce-eyed, long-horned bullocks. Accustomed as she was to\ndeal with cattle, she was not alarmed at her situation, but took\nadvantage of every opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of\npushing her way through the cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one\nof the creatures, either by accident or design, came in violent contact\nwith the flank of the mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant\nit reared up upon its hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and\ntossed in a way that would have unseated any but a most skilful rider.\nThe situation was full of peril. Every plunge of the excited horse\nbrought it against the horns again, and goaded it to fresh madness. It\nwas all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle, yet a\nslip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and\nterrified animals. Unaccustomed to sudden emergencies, her head began\nto swim, and her grip upon the bridle to relax. Choked by the rising\ncloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures, she might\nhave abandoned her efforts in despair, but for a kindly voice at her\nelbow which assured her of assistance. At the same moment a sinewy\nbrown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb, and forcing a way\nthrough the drove, soon brought her to the outskirts.",
      "“You’re not hurt, I hope, miss,” said her preserver, respectfully.\n\nShe looked up at his dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily. “I’m awful\nfrightened,” she said, naively; “whoever would have thought that Poncho\nwould have been so scared by a lot of cows?”\n\n“Thank God you kept your seat,” the other said earnestly. He was a\ntall, savage-looking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan horse,\nand clad in the rough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle slung over\nhis shoulders. “I guess you are the daughter of John Ferrier,” he\nremarked, “I saw you ride down from his house. When you see him, ask\nhim if he remembers the Jefferson Hopes of St. Louis. If he’s the same\nFerrier, my father and he were pretty thick.”\n\n“Hadn’t you better come and ask yourself?” she asked, demurely.\n\nThe young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion, and his dark eyes\nsparkled with pleasure. “I’ll do so,” he said, “we’ve been in the\nmountains for two months, and are not over and above in visiting\ncondition. He must take us as he finds us.”\n\n“He has a good deal to thank you for, and so have I,” she answered,\n“he’s awful fond of me. If those cows had jumped on me he’d have never\ngot over it.”\n\n“Neither would I,” said her companion.\n\n“You! Well, I don’t see that it would make much matter to you, anyhow.\nYou ain’t even a friend of ours.”",
      "The young hunter’s dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that Lucy\nFerrier laughed aloud.\n\n“There, I didn’t mean that,” she said; “of course, you are a friend\nnow. You must come and see us. Now I must push along, or father won’t\ntrust me with his business any more. Good-bye!”\n\n“Good-bye,” he answered, raising his broad sombrero, and bending over\nher little hand. She wheeled her mustang round, gave it a cut with her\nriding-whip, and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of\ndust.",
      "Young Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn.\nHe and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver,\nand were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital\nenough to work some lodes which they had discovered. He had been as\nkeen as any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had\ndrawn his thoughts into another channel. The sight of the fair young\ngirl, as frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred his\nvolcanic, untamed heart to its very depths. When she had vanished from\nhis sight, he realized that a crisis had come in his life, and that\nneither silver speculations nor any other questions could ever be of\nsuch importance to him as this new and all-absorbing one. The love\nwhich had sprung up in his heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy\nof a boy, but rather the wild, fierce passion of a man of strong will\nand imperious temper. He had been accustomed to succeed in all that he\nundertook. He swore in his heart that he would not fail in this if\nhuman effort and human perseverance could render him successful.",
      "He called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until his\nface was a familiar one at the farm-house. John, cooped up in the\nvalley, and absorbed in his work, had had little chance of learning the\nnews of the outside world during the last twelve years. All this\nJefferson Hope was able to tell him, and in a style which interested\nLucy as well as her father. He had been a pioneer in California, and\ncould narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost in\nthose wild, halcyon days. He had been a scout too, and a trapper, a\nsilver explorer, and a ranchman. Wherever stirring adventures were to\nbe had, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. He soon became\na favourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues.\nOn such occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her\nbright, happy eyes, showed only too clearly that her young heart was no\nlonger her own. Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms,\nbut they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her\naffections.\n\nIt was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled\nup at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him. He\nthrew the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway.",
      "“I am off, Lucy,” he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing\ntenderly down into her face; “I won’t ask you to come with me now, but\nwill you be ready to come when I am here again?”\n\n“And when will that be?” she asked, blushing and laughing.\n\n“A couple of months at the outside. I will come and claim you then, my\ndarling. There’s no one who can stand between us.”\n\n“And how about father?” she asked.\n\n“He has given his consent, provided we get these mines working all\nright. I have no fear on that head.”\n\n“Oh, well; of course, if you and father have arranged it all, there’s\nno more to be said,” she whispered, with her cheek against his broad\nbreast.\n\n“Thank God!” he said, hoarsely, stooping and kissing her. “It is\nsettled, then. The longer I stay, the harder it will be to go. They are\nwaiting for me at the cañon. Good-bye, my own darling—good-bye. In two\nmonths you shall see me.”\n\nHe tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging himself upon his\nhorse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though\nafraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at what\nhe was leaving. She stood at the gate, gazing after him until he\nvanished from her sight. Then she walked back into the house, the\nhappiest girl in all Utah.\n\nCHAPTER III.\nJOHN FERRIER TALKS WITH THE PROPHET.",
      "Three weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope and his comrades had\ndeparted from Salt Lake City. John Ferrier’s heart was sore within him\nwhen he thought of the young man’s return, and of the impending loss of\nhis adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to the\narrangement more than any argument could have done. He had always\ndetermined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing would ever\ninduce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a marriage he\nregarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. Whatever\nhe might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he was\ninflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for to\nexpress an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in\nthe Land of the Saints.\n\nYes, a dangerous matter—so dangerous that even the most saintly dared\nonly whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest something\nwhich fell from their lips might be misconstrued, and bring down a\nswift retribution upon them. The victims of persecution had now turned\npersecutors on their own account, and persecutors of the most terrible\ndescription. Not the Inquisition of Seville, nor the German\nVehmgericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able to put\na more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over\nthe State of Utah.",
      "Its invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made this\norganization doubly terrible. It appeared to be omniscient and\nomnipotent, and yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held out\nagainst the Church vanished away, and none knew whither he had gone or\nwhat had befallen him. His wife and his children awaited him at home,\nbut no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the hands\nof his secret judges. A rash word or a hasty act was followed by\nannihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be of this\nterrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that men went\nabout in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of the\nwilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them.",
      "At first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the\nrecalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards\nto pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a wider range. The\nsupply of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a female\npopulation on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. Strange\nrumours began to be bandied about—rumours of murdered immigrants and\nrifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen. Fresh women\nappeared in the harems of the Elders—women who pined and wept, and bore\nupon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror. Belated\nwanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked,\nstealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in the darkness. These\ntales and rumours took substance and shape, and were corroborated and\nre-corroborated, until they resolved themselves into a definite name.\nTo this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the Danite\nBand, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened one.",
      "Fuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible\nresults served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it\ninspired in the minds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthless\nsociety. The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and\nviolence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret.\nThe very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the\nProphet and his mission, might be one of those who would come forth at\nnight with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation. Hence every\nman feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which were\nnearest his heart.\n\nOne fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields,\nwhen he heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window,\nsaw a stout, sandy-haired, middle-aged man coming up the pathway. His\nheart leapt to his mouth, for this was none other than the great\nBrigham Young himself. Full of trepidation—for he knew that such a\nvisit boded him little good—Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon\nchief. The latter, however, received his salutations coldly, and\nfollowed him with a stern face into the sitting-room.",
      "“Brother Ferrier,” he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly\nfrom under his light-coloured eyelashes, “the true believers have been\ngood friends to you. We picked you up when you were starving in the\ndesert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley,\ngave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to wax rich under our\nprotection. Is not this so?”\n\n“It is so,” answered John Ferrier.\n\n“In return for all this we asked but one condition: that was, that you\nshould embrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages.\nThis you promised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you\nhave neglected.”\n\n“And how have I neglected it?” asked Ferrier, throwing out his hands in\nexpostulation. “Have I not given to the common fund? Have I not\nattended at the Temple? Have I not——?”\n\n“Where are your wives?” asked Young, looking round him. “Call them in,\nthat I may greet them.”\n\n“It is true that I have not married,” Ferrier answered. “But women were\nfew, and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a\nlonely man: I had my daughter to attend to my wants.”\n\n“It is of that daughter that I would speak to you,” said the leader of\nthe Mormons. “She has grown to be the flower of Utah, and has found\nfavour in the eyes of many who are high in the land.”\n\nJohn Ferrier groaned internally.",
      "“There are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve—stories that\nshe is sealed to some Gentile. This must be the gossip of idle tongues.\nWhat is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith?\n‘Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect; for if she\nwed a Gentile, she commits a grievous sin.’ This being so, it is\nimpossible that you, who profess the holy creed, should suffer your\ndaughter to violate it.”\n\nJohn Ferrier made no answer, but he played nervously with his\nriding-whip.\n\n“Upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested—so it has been\ndecided in the Sacred Council of Four. The girl is young, and we would\nnot have her wed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of all\nchoice. We Elders have many heifers,[1] but our children must also be\nprovided. Stangerson has a son, and Drebber has a son, and either of\nthem would gladly welcome your daughter to their house. Let her choose\nbetween them. They are young and rich, and of the true faith. What say\nyou to that?”\n\n[1] Heber C. Kemball, in one of his sermons, alludes to his hundred\n    wives under this endearing epithet.\n\nFerrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted.\n\n“You will give us time,” he said at last. “My daughter is very\nyoung—she is scarce of an age to marry.”",
      "“She shall have a month to choose,” said Young, rising from his seat.\n“At the end of that time she shall give her answer.”\n\nHe was passing through the door, when he turned, with flushed face and\nflashing eyes. “It were better for you, John Ferrier,” he thundered,\n“that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra\nBlanco, than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of\nthe Holy Four!”\n\nWith a threatening gesture of his hand, he turned from the door, and\nFerrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path.\n\nHe was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees, considering how he\nshould broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon\nhis, and looking up, he saw her standing beside him. One glance at her\npale, frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed.\n\n“I could not help it,” she said, in answer to his look. “His voice rang\nthrough the house. Oh, father, father, what shall we do?”\n\n“Don’t you scare yourself,” he answered, drawing her to him, and\npassing his broad, rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair.\n“We’ll fix it up somehow or another. You don’t find your fancy kind o’\nlessening for this chap, do you?”\n\nA sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer.",
      "“No; of course not. I shouldn’t care to hear you say you did. He’s a\nlikely lad, and he’s a Christian, which is more than these folk here,\nin spite o’ all their praying and preaching. There’s a party starting\nfor Nevada to-morrow, and I’ll manage to send him a message letting him\nknow the hole we are in. If I know anything o’ that young man, he’ll be\nback here with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs.”\n\nLucy laughed through her tears at her father’s description.\n\n“When he comes, he will advise us for the best. But it is for you that\nI am frightened, dear. One hears—one hears such dreadful stories about\nthose who oppose the Prophet: something terrible always happens to\nthem.”\n\n“But we haven’t opposed him yet,” her father answered. “It will be time\nto look out for squalls when we do. We have a clear month before us; at\nthe end of that, I guess we had best shin out of Utah.”\n\n“Leave Utah!”\n\n“That’s about the size of it.”\n\n“But the farm?”\n\n“We will raise as much as we can in money, and let the rest go. To tell\nthe truth, Lucy, it isn’t the first time I have thought of doing it. I\ndon’t care about knuckling under to any man, as these folk do to their\ndarned prophet. I’m a free-born American, and it’s all new to me. Guess\nI’m too old to learn. If he comes browsing about this farm, he might\nchance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the\nopposite direction.”",
      "“But they won’t let us leave,” his daughter objected.\n\n“Wait till Jefferson comes, and we’ll soon manage that. In the\nmeantime, don’t you fret yourself, my dearie, and don’t get your eyes\nswelled up, else he’ll be walking into me when he sees you. There’s\nnothing to be afeared about, and there’s no danger at all.”\n\nJohn Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone,\nbut she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the\nfastening of the doors that night, and that he carefully cleaned and\nloaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom.\n\nCHAPTER IV.\nA FLIGHT FOR LIFE.\n\nOn the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet,\nJohn Ferrier went in to Salt Lake City, and having found his\nacquaintance, who was bound for the Nevada Mountains, he entrusted him\nwith his message to Jefferson Hope. In it he told the young man of the\nimminent danger which threatened them, and how necessary it was that he\nshould return. Having done thus he felt easier in his mind, and\nreturned home with a lighter heart.",
      "As he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to\neach of the posts of the gate. Still more surprised was he on entering\nto find two young men in possession of his sitting-room. One, with a\nlong pale face, was leaning back in the rocking-chair, with his feet\ncocked up upon the stove. The other, a bull-necked youth with coarse\nbloated features, was standing in front of the window with his hands in\nhis pocket, whistling a popular hymn. Both of them nodded to Ferrier as\nhe entered, and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the\nconversation.\n\n“Maybe you don’t know us,” he said. “This here is the son of Elder\nDrebber, and I’m Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the\ndesert when the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the\ntrue fold.”\n\n“As He will all the nations in His own good time,” said the other in a\nnasal voice; “He grindeth slowly but exceeding small.”\n\nJohn Ferrier bowed coldly. He had guessed who his visitors were.\n\n“We have come,” continued Stangerson, “at the advice of our fathers to\nsolicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to\nyou and to her. As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has\nseven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one.”",
      "“Nay, nay, Brother Stangerson,” cried the other; “the question is not\nhow many wives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now\ngiven over his mills to me, and I am the richer man.”\n\n“But my prospects are better,” said the other, warmly. “When the Lord\nremoves my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather\nfactory. Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church.”\n\n“It will be for the maiden to decide,” rejoined young Drebber, smirking\nat his own reflection in the glass. “We will leave it all to her\ndecision.”\n\nDuring this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway,\nhardly able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors.\n\n“Look here,” he said at last, striding up to them, “when my daughter\nsummons you, you can come, but until then I don’t want to see your\nfaces again.”\n\nThe two young Mormons stared at him in amazement. In their eyes this\ncompetition between them for the maiden’s hand was the highest of\nhonours both to her and her father.\n\n“There are two ways out of the room,” cried Ferrier; “there is the\ndoor, and there is the window. Which do you care to use?”\n\nHis brown face looked so savage, and his gaunt hands so threatening,\nthat his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat. The\nold farmer followed them to the door.\n\n“Let me know when you have settled which it is to be,” he said,\nsardonically.",
      "“You shall smart for this!” Stangerson cried, white with rage. “You\nhave defied the Prophet and the Council of Four. You shall rue it to\nthe end of your days.”\n\n“The hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you,” cried young Drebber;\n“He will arise and smite you!”\n\n“Then I’ll start the smiting,” exclaimed Ferrier furiously, and would\nhave rushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm and\nrestrained him. Before he could escape from her, the clatter of horses’\nhoofs told him that they were beyond his reach.\n\n“The young canting rascals!” he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from\nhis forehead; “I would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the\nwife of either of them.”\n\n“And so should I, father,” she answered, with spirit; “but Jefferson\nwill soon be here.”\n\n“Yes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for\nwe do not know what their next move may be.”",
      "It was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and\nhelp should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted\ndaughter. In the whole history of the settlement there had never been\nsuch a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders. If\nminor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this\narch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no\navail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had been\nspirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. He\nwas a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which\nhung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip, but this\nsuspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter,\nhowever, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she,\nwith the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease.\n\nHe expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from\nYoung as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an\nunlooked-for manner. Upon rising next morning he found, to his\nsurprise, a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed\njust over his chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling letters:—\n\n“Twenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then——”",
      "The dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. How\nthis warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his\nservants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been\nsecured. He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter, but\nthe incident struck a chill into his heart. The twenty-nine days were\nevidently the balance of the month which Young had promised. What\nstrength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such\nmysterious powers? The hand which fastened that pin might have struck\nhim to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him.\n\nStill more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their\nbreakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the\ncentre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently, the\nnumber 28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not\nenlighten her. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and\nward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27\nhad been painted upon the outside of his door.",
      "Thus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his\nunseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some\nconspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the\nmonth of grace. Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls,\nsometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards\nstuck upon the garden gate or the railings. With all his vigilance John\nFerrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded. A\nhorror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of\nthem. He became haggard and restless, and his eyes had the troubled\nlook of some hunted creature. He had but one hope in life now, and that\nwas for the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada.",
      "Twenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no news\nof the absentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there\ncame no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a\ndriver shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking\nthat help had arrived at last. At last, when he saw five give way to\nfour and that again to three, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope of\nescape. Single-handed, and with his limited knowledge of the mountains\nwhich surrounded the settlement, he knew that he was powerless. The\nmore-frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none could\npass along them without an order from the Council. Turn which way he\nwould, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him.\nYet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life\nitself before he consented to what he regarded as his daughter’s\ndishonour.",
      "He was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles,\nand searching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown\nthe figure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the\nlast of the allotted time. What was to happen then? All manner of vague\nand terrible fancies filled his imagination. And his daughter—what was\nto become of her after he was gone? Was there no escape from the\ninvisible network which was drawn all round them. He sank his head upon\nthe table and sobbed at the thought of his own impotence.\n\nWhat was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound—low,\nbut very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from the door of\nthe house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There was\na pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was\nrepeated. Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the\npanels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry\nout the murderous orders of the secret tribunal? Or was it some agent\nwho was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrier\nfelt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook\nhis nerves and chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt\nand threw the door open.",
      "Outside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars were\ntwinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before the\nfarmer’s eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on\nthe road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier\nlooked to right and to left, until happening to glance straight down at\nhis own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face\nupon the ground, with arms and legs all asprawl.\n\nSo unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with\nhis hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out. His first\nthought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying\nman, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into\nthe hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent. Once within\nthe house the man sprang to his feet, closed the door, and revealed to\nthe astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of\nJefferson Hope.\n\n“Good God!” gasped John Ferrier. “How you scared me! Whatever made you\ncome in like that.”\n\n“Give me food,” the other said, hoarsely. “I have had no time for bite\nor sup for eight-and-forty hours.” He flung himself upon the cold meat\nand bread which were still lying upon the table from his host’s supper,\nand devoured it voraciously. “Does Lucy bear up well?” he asked, when\nhe had satisfied his hunger.",
      "“Yes. She does not know the danger,” her father answered.\n\n“That is well. The house is watched on every side. That is why I\ncrawled my way up to it. They may be darned sharp, but they’re not\nquite sharp enough to catch a Washoe hunter.”\n\nJohn Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had a\ndevoted ally. He seized the young man’s leathery hand and wrung it\ncordially. “You’re a man to be proud of,” he said. “There are not many\nwho would come to share our danger and our troubles.”\n\n“You’ve hit it there, pard,” the young hunter answered. “I have a\nrespect for you, but if you were alone in this business I’d think twice\nbefore I put my head into such a hornet’s nest. It’s Lucy that brings\nme here, and before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o’\nthe Hope family in Utah.”\n\n“What are we to do?”\n\n“To-morrow is your last day, and unless you act to-night you are lost.\nI have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. How much\nmoney have you?”\n\n“Two thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes.”\n\n“That will do. I have as much more to add to it. We must push for\nCarson City through the mountains. You had best wake Lucy. It is as\nwell that the servants do not sleep in the house.”",
      "While Ferrier was absent, preparing his daughter for the approaching\njourney, Jefferson Hope packed all the eatables that he could find into\na small parcel, and filled a stoneware jar with water, for he knew by\nexperience that the mountain wells were few and far between. He had\nhardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his\ndaughter all dressed and ready for a start. The greeting between the\nlovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious, and there was\nmuch to be done.\n\n“We must make our start at once,” said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a\nlow but resolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the\nperil, but has steeled his heart to meet it. “The front and back\nentrances are watched, but with caution we may get away through the\nside window and across the fields. Once on the road we are only two\nmiles from the Ravine where the horses are waiting. By daybreak we\nshould be half-way through the mountains.”\n\n“What if we are stopped,” asked Ferrier.\n\nHope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his\ntunic. “If they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them\nwith us,” he said with a sinister smile.",
      "The lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from the\ndarkened window Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own,\nand which he was now about to abandon for ever. He had long nerved\nhimself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour and\nhappiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes.\nAll looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broad\nsilent stretch of grain-land, that it was difficult to realize that the\nspirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet the white face and set\nexpression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house\nhe had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head.\n\nFerrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the\nscanty provisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a\nfew of her more valued possessions. Opening the window very slowly and\ncarefully, they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the\nnight, and then one by one passed through into the little garden. With\nbated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and gained\nthe shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap\nwhich opened into the cornfields. They had just reached this point when\nthe young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the\nshadow, where they lay silent and trembling.",
      "It was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the\nears of a lynx. He and his friends had hardly crouched down before the\nmelancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards of\nthem, which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small\ndistance. At the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the\ngap for which they had been making, and uttered the plaintive signal\ncry again, on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity.\n\n“To-morrow at midnight,” said the first who appeared to be in\nauthority. “When the Whip-poor-Will calls three times.”\n\n“It is well,” returned the other. “Shall I tell Brother Drebber?”\n\n“Pass it on to him, and from him to the others. Nine to seven!”\n\n“Seven to five!” repeated the other, and the two figures flitted away\nin different directions. Their concluding words had evidently been some\nform of sign and countersign. The instant that their footsteps had died\naway in the distance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet, and helping\nhis companions through the gap, led the way across the fields at the\ntop of his speed, supporting and half-carrying the girl when her\nstrength appeared to fail her.\n\n“Hurry on! hurry on!” he gasped from time to time. “We are through the\nline of sentinels. Everything depends on speed. Hurry on!”",
      "Once on the high road they made rapid progress. Only once did they meet\nanyone, and then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoid\nrecognition. Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a\nrugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. Two dark jagged\npeaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile which led\nbetween them was the Eagle Cañon in which the horses were awaiting\nthem. With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the\ngreat boulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse, until he\ncame to the retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful\nanimals had been picketed. The girl was placed upon the mule, and old\nFerrier upon one of the horses, with his money-bag, while Jefferson\nHope led the other along the precipitous and dangerous path.",
      "It was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face\nNature in her wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up a\nthousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic\ncolumns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified\nmonster. On the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all\nadvance impossible. Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow\nin places that they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that\nonly practised riders could have traversed it at all. Yet in spite of\nall dangers and difficulties, the hearts of the fugitives were light\nwithin them, for every step increased the distance between them and the\nterrible despotism from which they were flying.\n\nThey soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the\njurisdiction of the Saints. They had reached the very wildest and most\ndesolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry, and\npointed upwards. On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark\nand plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. He saw them\nas soon as they perceived him, and his military challenge of “Who goes\nthere?” rang through the silent ravine.\n\n“Travellers for Nevada,” said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon the\nrifle which hung by his saddle.",
      "They could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down\nat them as if dissatisfied at their reply.\n\n“By whose permission?” he asked.\n\n“The Holy Four,” answered Ferrier. His Mormon experiences had taught\nhim that that was the highest authority to which he could refer.\n\n“Nine from seven,” cried the sentinel.\n\n“Seven from five,” returned Jefferson Hope promptly, remembering the\ncountersign which he had heard in the garden.\n\n“Pass, and the Lord go with you,” said the voice from above. Beyond his\npost the path broadened out, and the horses were able to break into a\ntrot. Looking back, they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon\nhis gun, and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosen\npeople, and that freedom lay before them.\n\nCHAPTER V.\nTHE AVENGING ANGELS.",
      "All night their course lay through intricate defiles and over irregular\nand rock-strewn paths. More than once they lost their way, but Hope’s\nintimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track\nonce more. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage\nbeauty lay before them. In every direction the great snow-capped peaks\nhemmed them in, peeping over each other’s shoulders to the far horizon.\nSo steep were the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larch\nand the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only\na gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. Nor was the fear\nentirely an illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with\ntrees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they\npassed, a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which\nwoke the echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses\ninto a gallop.",
      "As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great\nmountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until\nthey were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered the\nhearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild\ntorrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered\ntheir horses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast. Lucy and her\nfather would fain have rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was\ninexorable. “They will be upon our track by this time,” he said.\n“Everything depends upon our speed. Once safe in Carson we may rest for\nthe remainder of our lives.”\n\nDuring the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, and\nby evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from\ntheir enemies. At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag,\nwhere the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there\nhuddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours’ sleep. Before\ndaybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more. They had\nseen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think that\nthey were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose\nenmity they had incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp could\nreach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them.",
      "About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store\nof provisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness,\nhowever, for there was game to be had among the mountains, and he had\nfrequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life.\nChoosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and\nmade a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for\nthey were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the\nair was bitter and keen. Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy\nadieu, he threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of\nwhatever chance might throw in his way. Looking back he saw the old man\nand the young girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three\nanimals stood motionless in the back-ground. Then the intervening rocks\nhid them from his view.",
      "He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another\nwithout success, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and\nother indications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the\nvicinity. At last, after two or three hours’ fruitless search, he was\nthinking of turning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he\nsaw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart. On the\nedge of a jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there\nstood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed\nwith a pair of gigantic horns. The big-horn—for so it is called—was\nacting, probably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to\nthe hunter; but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction,\nand had not perceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon\na rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The\nanimal sprang into the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the\nprecipice, and then came crashing down into the valley beneath.",
      "The creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself\nwith cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this trophy\nover his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening\nwas already drawing in. He had hardly started, however, before he\nrealized the difficulty which faced him. In his eagerness he had\nwandered far past the ravines which were known to him, and it was no\neasy matter to pick out the path which he had taken. The valley in\nwhich he found himself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which\nwere so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from\nthe other. He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a\nmountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before.\nConvinced that he had taken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with\nthe same result. Night was coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark\nbefore he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him.\nEven then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track, for the\nmoon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs on either side made the\nobscurity more profound. Weighed down with his burden, and weary from\nhis exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart by the\nreflection that every step brought him nearer to Lucy, and that he\ncarried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their\njourney.",
      "He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left\nthem. Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs\nwhich bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously,\nfor he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart\nhe put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud\nhalloo as a signal that he was coming. He paused and listened for an\nanswer. None came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary\nsilent ravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless\nrepetitions. Again he shouted, even louder than before, and again no\nwhisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time\nago. A vague, nameless dread came over him, and he hurried onwards\nfrantically, dropping the precious food in his agitation.\n\nWhen he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the\nfire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there,\nbut it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The same dead\nsilence still reigned all round. With his fears all changed to\nconvictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near the\nremains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only\ntoo clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during\nhis absence—a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no\ntraces behind it.",
      "Bewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin\nround, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He\nwas essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from\nhis temporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the\nsmouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help\nto examine the little camp. The ground was all stamped down by the feet\nof horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the\nfugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had\nafterwards turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried back both of\nhis companions with them? Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself\nthat they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which\nmade every nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one\nside of the camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had\nassuredly not been there before. There was no mistaking it for anything\nbut a newly-dug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he perceived\nthat a stick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the\ncleft fork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the\npoint:\n\nJOHN FERRIER,\nFORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY,\nDied August 4th, 1860.",
      "The sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone,\nthen, and this was all his epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round\nto see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy\nhad been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original\ndestiny, by becoming one of the harem of the Elder’s son. As the young\nfellow realized the certainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness to\nprevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in\nhis last silent resting-place.",
      "Again, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs\nfrom despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least\ndevote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance,\nJefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness,\nwhich he may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived.\nAs he stood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which\ncould assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution,\nbrought by his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring\nenergy should, he determined, be devoted to that one end. With a grim,\nwhite face, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and\nhaving stirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him\nfor a few days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he\nset himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the\navenging angels.",
      "For five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he\nhad already traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down\namong the rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak\nhe was always well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle\nCañon, from which they had commenced their ill-fated flight. Thence he\ncould look down upon the home of the saints. Worn and exhausted, he\nleaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent\nwidespread city beneath him. As he looked at it, he observed that there\nwere flags in some of the principal streets, and other signs of\nfestivity. He was still speculating as to what this might mean when he\nheard the clatter of horse’s hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding\ntowards him. As he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named\nCowper, to whom he had rendered services at different times. He\ntherefore accosted him when he got up to him, with the object of\nfinding out what Lucy Ferrier’s fate had been.\n\n“I am Jefferson Hope,” he said. “You remember me.”\n\nThe Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment—indeed, it was\ndifficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly\nwhite face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of former\ndays. Having, however, at last, satisfied himself as to his identity,\nthe man’s surprise changed to consternation.",
      "“You are mad to come here,” he cried. “It is as much as my own life is\nworth to be seen talking with you. There is a warrant against you from\nthe Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away.”\n\n“I don’t fear them, or their warrant,” Hope said, earnestly. “You must\nknow something of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything you\nhold dear to answer a few questions. We have always been friends. For\nGod’s sake, don’t refuse to answer me.”\n\n“What is it?” the Mormon asked uneasily. “Be quick. The very rocks have\nears and the trees eyes.”\n\n“What has become of Lucy Ferrier?”\n\n“She was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up, you\nhave no life left in you.”\n\n“Don’t mind me,” said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips, and\nhad sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning. “Married,\nyou say?”\n\n“Married yesterday—that’s what those flags are for on the Endowment\nHouse. There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson\nas to which was to have her. They’d both been in the party that\nfollowed them, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give\nhim the best claim; but when they argued it out in council, Drebber’s\nparty was the stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to him. No one\nwon’t have her very long though, for I saw death in her face yesterday.\nShe is more like a ghost than a woman. Are you off, then?”",
      "“Yes, I am off,” said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat. His\nface might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was its\nexpression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.\n\n“Where are you going?”\n\n“Never mind,” he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his shoulder,\nstrode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains\nto the haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there was none so\nfierce and so dangerous as himself.",
      "The prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it\nwas the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful\nmarriage into which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her\nhead again, but pined away and died within a month. Her sottish\nhusband, who had married her principally for the sake of John Ferrier’s\nproperty, did not affect any great grief at his bereavement; but his\nother wives mourned over her, and sat up with her the night before the\nburial, as is the Mormon custom. They were grouped round the bier in\nthe early hours of the morning, when, to their inexpressible fear and\nastonishment, the door was flung open, and a savage-looking,\nweather-beaten man in tattered garments strode into the room. Without a\nglance or a word to the cowering women, he walked up to the white\nsilent figure which had once contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier.\nStooping over her, he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead,\nand then, snatching up her hand, he took the wedding-ring from her\nfinger. “She shall not be buried in that,” he cried with a fierce\nsnarl, and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and\nwas gone. So strange and so brief was the episode, that the watchers\nmight have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other\npeople of it, had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet\nof gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared.",
      "For some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading a\nstrange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for\nvengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the weird\nfigure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted the\nlonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson’s\nwindow and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. On\nanother occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder\ncrashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing\nhimself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long in\ndiscovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led\nrepeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or\nkilling their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted the\nprecaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of having\ntheir houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax these\nmeasures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, and\nthey hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.",
      "Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter’s mind\nwas of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revenge\nhad taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for any\nother emotion. He was, however, above all things practical. He soon\nrealized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant\nstrain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and want of wholesome\nfood were wearing him out. If he died like a dog among the mountains,\nwhat was to become of his revenge then? And yet such a death was sure\nto overtake him if he persisted. He felt that that was to play his\nenemy’s game, so he reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines, there\nto recruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue\nhis object without privation.",
      "His intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a\ncombination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines\nfor nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory of his\nwrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that\nmemorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier’s grave. Disguised,\nand under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City, careless what\nbecame of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew to be\njustice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There had been a\nschism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the younger\nmembers of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the\nElders, and the result had been the secession of a certain number of\nthe malcontents, who had left Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had\nbeen Drebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone.\nRumour reported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his\nproperty into money, and that he had departed a wealthy man, while his\ncompanion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor. There was no clue at\nall, however, as to their whereabouts.",
      "Many a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of\nrevenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never\nfaltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked out\nby such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to town\nthrough the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed into\nyear, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a human\nbloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he\nhad devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded. It was but\na glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him that\nCleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. He\nreturned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all\narranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window,\nhad recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder in his\neyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by\nStangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to\nhim that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and\nhatred of an old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into\ncustody, and not being able to find sureties, was detained for some\nweeks. When at last he was liberated, it was only to find that\nDrebber’s house was deserted, and that he and his secretary had\ndeparted for Europe.",
      "Again the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred\nurged him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and for\nsome time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his\napproaching journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in\nhim, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to city,\nworking his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking the\nfugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris;\nand when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off\nfor Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days late, for\nthey had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded in running\nthem to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do better than\nquote the old hunter’s own account, as duly recorded in Dr. Watson’s\nJournal, to which we are already under such obligations.\n\nCHAPTER VI.\nA CONTINUATION OF THE REMINISCENCES OF JOHN WATSON, M.D.",
      "Our prisoner’s furious resistance did not apparently indicate any\nferocity in his disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself\npowerless, he smiled in an affable manner, and expressed his hopes that\nhe had not hurt any of us in the scuffle. “I guess you’re going to take\nme to the police-station,” he remarked to Sherlock Holmes. “My cab’s at\nthe door. If you’ll loose my legs I’ll walk down to it. I’m not so\nlight to lift as I used to be.”\n\nGregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this\nproposition rather a bold one; but Holmes at once took the prisoner at\nhis word, and loosened the towel which we had bound round his ankles.\nHe rose and stretched his legs, as though to assure himself that they\nwere free once more. I remember that I thought to myself, as I eyed\nhim, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man; and his dark\nsunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was\nas formidable as his personal strength.\n\n“If there’s a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you are\nthe man for it,” he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at my\nfellow-lodger. “The way you kept on my trail was a caution.”\n\n“You had better come with me,” said Holmes to the two detectives.\n\n“I can drive you,” said Lestrade.",
      "“Good! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have\ntaken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us.”\n\nI assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made no\nattempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his,\nand we followed him. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the horse,\nand brought us in a very short time to our destination. We were ushered\ninto a small chamber where a police Inspector noted down our prisoner’s\nname and the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged.\nThe official was a white-faced unemotional man, who went through his\nduties in a dull mechanical way. “The prisoner will be put before the\nmagistrates in the course of the week,” he said; “in the mean time, Mr.\nJefferson Hope, have you anything that you wish to say? I must warn you\nthat your words will be taken down, and may be used against you.”\n\n“I’ve got a good deal to say,” our prisoner said slowly. “I want to\ntell you gentlemen all about it.”\n\n“Hadn’t you better reserve that for your trial?” asked the Inspector.\n\n“I may never be tried,” he answered. “You needn’t look startled. It\nisn’t suicide I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor?” He turned his fierce\ndark eyes upon me as he asked this last question.\n\n“Yes; I am,” I answered.\n\n“Then put your hand here,” he said, with a smile, motioning with his\nmanacled wrists towards his chest.",
      "I did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing\nand commotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest seemed\nto thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some\npowerful engine was at work. In the silence of the room I could hear a\ndull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source.\n\n“Why,” I cried, “you have an aortic aneurism!”\n\n“That’s what they call it,” he said, placidly. “I went to a doctor last\nweek about it, and he told me that it is bound to burst before many\ndays passed. It has been getting worse for years. I got it from\nover-exposure and under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. I’ve\ndone my work now, and I don’t care how soon I go, but I should like to\nleave some account of the business behind me. I don’t want to be\nremembered as a common cut-throat.”\n\nThe Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the\nadvisability of allowing him to tell his story.\n\n“Do you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger?” the former\nasked.\n\n“Most certainly there is,” I answered.\n\n“In that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to\ntake his statement,” said the Inspector. “You are at liberty, sir, to\ngive your account, which I again warn you will be taken down.”",
      "“I’ll sit down, with your leave,” the prisoner said, suiting the action\nto the word. “This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and the\ntussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters. I’m on the brink\nof the grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. Every word I say is\nthe absolute truth, and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to\nme.”\n\nWith these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began the\nfollowing remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical\nmanner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough.\nI can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I have had\naccess to Lestrade’s note-book, in which the prisoner’s words were\ntaken down exactly as they were uttered.\n\n“It don’t much matter to you why I hated these men,” he said; “it’s\nenough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings—a father\nand a daughter—and that they had, therefore, forfeited their own lives.\nAfter the lapse of time that has passed since their crime, it was\nimpossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court. I\nknew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should be judge,\njury, and executioner all rolled into one. You’d have done the same, if\nyou have any manhood in you, if you had been in my place.",
      "“That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago. She\nwas forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart over\nit. I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed that his\ndying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his last thoughts\nshould be of the crime for which he was punished. I have carried it\nabout with me, and have followed him and his accomplice over two\ncontinents until I caught them. They thought to tire me out, but they\ncould not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is likely enough, I die knowing\nthat my work in this world is done, and well done. They have perished,\nand by my hand. There is nothing left for me to hope for, or to desire.",
      "“They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me to\nfollow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I\nfound that I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving and\nriding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a cabowner’s\noffice, and soon got employment. I was to bring a certain sum a week to\nthe owner, and whatever was over that I might keep for myself. There\nwas seldom much over, but I managed to scrape along somehow. The\nhardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon that of all the\nmazes that ever were contrived, this city is the most confusing. I had\na map beside me though, and when once I had spotted the principal\nhotels and stations, I got on pretty well.\n\n“It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were\nliving; but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across\nthem. They were at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other\nside of the river. When once I found them out I knew that I had them at\nmy mercy. I had grown my beard, and there was no chance of their\nrecognizing me. I would dog them and follow them until I saw my\nopportunity. I was determined that they should not escape me again.",
      "“They were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about\nLondon, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my\ncab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then they\ncould not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or late at\nnight that I could earn anything, so that I began to get behindhand\nwith my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long as I could lay\nmy hand upon the men I wanted.\n\n“They were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there was\nsome chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone,\nand never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind them every\nday, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was drunk half\nthe time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I watched them\nlate and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but I was not\ndiscouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost come. My\nonly fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon\nand leave my work undone.",
      "“At last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the\nstreet was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to\ntheir door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a time\nDrebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up my\nhorse and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for I\nfeared that they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston Station\nthey got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed them on\nto the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train, and the\nguard answer that one had just gone and there would not be another for\nsome hours. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Drebber was\nrather pleased than otherwise. I got so close to them in the bustle\nthat I could hear every word that passed between them. Drebber said\nthat he had a little business of his own to do, and that if the other\nwould wait for him he would soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrated\nwith him, and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together.\nDrebber answered that the matter was a delicate one, and that he must\ngo alone. I could not catch what Stangerson said to that, but the other\nburst out swearing, and reminded him that he was nothing more than his\npaid servant, and that he must not presume to dictate to him. On that\nthe Secretary gave it up as a bad job, and simply bargained with him\nthat if he missed the last train he should rejoin him at Halliday’s\nPrivate Hotel; to which Drebber answered that he would be back on the\nplatform before eleven, and made his way out of the station.",
      "“The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my\nenemies within my power. Together they could protect each other, but\nsingly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue\nprecipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction\nin vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that\nstrikes him, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans\narranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who\nhad wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. It\nchanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in\nlooking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of one\nof them in my carriage. It was claimed that same evening, and returned;\nbut in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate\nconstructed. By means of this I had access to at least one spot in this\ngreat city where I could rely upon being free from interruption. How to\nget Drebber to that house was the difficult problem which I had now to\nsolve.",
      "“He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops, staying\nfor nearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he came out he\nstaggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was a\nhansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so close\nthat the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole\nway. We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets,\nuntil, to my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the Terrace in\nwhich he had boarded. I could not imagine what his intention was in\nreturning there; but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or\nso from the house. He entered it, and his hansom drove away. Give me a\nglass of water, if you please. My mouth gets dry with the talking.”\n\nI handed him the glass, and he drank it down.",
      "“That’s better,” he said. “Well, I waited for a quarter of an hour, or\nmore, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside\nthe house. Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared,\none of whom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap whom I had\nnever seen before. This fellow had Drebber by the collar, and when they\ncame to the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent\nhim half across the road. ‘You hound,’ he cried, shaking his stick at\nhim; ‘I’ll teach you to insult an honest girl!’ He was so hot that I\nthink he would have thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the cur\nstaggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him. He\nran as far as the corner, and then, seeing my cab, he hailed me and\njumped in. ‘Drive me to Halliday’s Private Hotel,’ said he.",
      "“When I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy that\nI feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I drove\nalong slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. I might\ntake him right out into the country, and there in some deserted lane\nhave my last interview with him. I had almost decided upon this, when\nhe solved the problem for me. The craze for drink had seized him again,\nand he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. He went in, leaving\nword that I should wait for him. There he remained until closing time,\nand when he came out he was so far gone that I knew the game was in my\nown hands.",
      "“Don’t imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. It would only\nhave been rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring myself\nto do it. I had long determined that he should have a show for his life\nif he chose to take advantage of it. Among the many billets which I\nhave filled in America during my wandering life, I was once janitor and\nsweeper out of the laboratory at York College. One day the professor\nwas lecturing on poisons, and he showed his students some alkaloid, as\nhe called it, which he had extracted from some South American arrow\npoison, and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant\ndeath. I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and\nwhen they were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it. I was a\nfairly good dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small, soluble\npills, and each pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without\nthe poison. I determined at the time that when I had my chance, my\ngentlemen should each have a draw out of one of these boxes, while I\nate the pill that remained. It would be quite as deadly, and a good\ndeal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief. From that day I had\nalways my pill boxes about with me, and the time had now come when I\nwas to use them.",
      "“It was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard\nand raining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad within—so\nglad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation. If any of you\ngentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for it during twenty\nlong years, and then suddenly found it within your reach, you would\nunderstand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and puffed at it to steady my\nnerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples throbbing with\nexcitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy\nlooking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me, just as plain as I\nsee you all in this room. All the way they were ahead of me, one on\neach side of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton\nRoad.\n\n“There was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the\ndripping of the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber\nall huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm, ‘It’s\ntime to get out,’ I said.\n\n“‘All right, cabby,’ said he.",
      "“I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned,\nfor he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden. I\nhad to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little\ntop-heavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him into the\nfront room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and the\ndaughter were walking in front of us.\n\n“‘It’s infernally dark,’ said he, stamping about.\n\n“‘We’ll soon have a light,’ I said, striking a match and putting it to\na wax candle which I had brought with me. ‘Now, Enoch Drebber,’ I\ncontinued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face, ‘who\nam I?’\n\n“He gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I saw\na horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, which\nshowed me that he knew me. He staggered back with a livid face, and I\nsaw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered\nin his head. At the sight, I leaned my back against the door and\nlaughed loud and long. I had always known that vengeance would be\nsweet, but I had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now\npossessed me.",
      "“‘You dog!’ I said; ‘I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St.\nPetersburg, and you have always escaped me. Now, at last your\nwanderings have come to an end, for either you or I shall never see\nto-morrow’s sun rise.’ He shrunk still further away as I spoke, and I\ncould see on his face that he thought I was mad. So I was for the time.\nThe pulses in my temples beat like sledge-hammers, and I believe I\nwould have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my\nnose and relieved me.\n\n“‘What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?’ I cried, locking the door,\nand shaking the key in his face. ‘Punishment has been slow in coming,\nbut it has overtaken you at last.’ I saw his coward lips tremble as I\nspoke. He would have begged for his life, but he knew well that it was\nuseless.\n\n“‘Would you murder me?’ he stammered.\n\n“‘There is no murder,’ I answered. ‘Who talks of murdering a mad dog?\nWhat mercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from her\nslaughtered father, and bore her away to your accursed and shameless\nharem.’\n\n“‘It was not I who killed her father,’ he cried.\n\n“‘But it was you who broke her innocent heart,’ I shrieked, thrusting\nthe box before him. ‘Let the high God judge between us. Choose and eat.\nThere is death in one and life in the other. I shall take what you\nleave. Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we are\nruled by chance.’",
      "“He cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my\nknife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I\nswallowed the other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a\nminute or more, waiting to see which was to live and which was to die.\nShall I ever forget the look which came over his face when the first\nwarning pangs told him that the poison was in his system? I laughed as\nI saw it, and held Lucy’s marriage ring in front of his eyes. It was\nbut for a moment, for the action of the alkaloid is rapid. A spasm of\npain contorted his features; he threw his hands out in front of him,\nstaggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily upon the floor. I\nturned him over with my foot, and placed my hand upon his heart. There\nwas no movement. He was dead!",
      "“The blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice\nof it. I don’t know what it was that put it into my head to write upon\nthe wall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the\npolice upon a wrong track, for I felt light-hearted and cheerful. I\nremembered a German being found in New York with RACHE written up above\nhim, and it was argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret\nsocieties must have done it. I guessed that what puzzled the New\nYorkers would puzzle the Londoners, so I dipped my finger in my own\nblood and printed it on a convenient place on the wall. Then I walked\ndown to my cab and found that there was nobody about, and that the\nnight was still very wild. I had driven some distance when I put my\nhand into the pocket in which I usually kept Lucy’s ring, and found\nthat it was not there. I was thunderstruck at this, for it was the only\nmemento that I had of her. Thinking that I might have dropped it when I\nstooped over Drebber’s body, I drove back, and leaving my cab in a side\nstreet, I went boldly up to the house—for I was ready to dare anything\nrather than lose the ring. When I arrived there, I walked right into\nthe arms of a police-officer who was coming out, and only managed to\ndisarm his suspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk.",
      "“That was how Enoch Drebber came to his end. All I had to do then was\nto do as much for Stangerson, and so pay off John Ferrier’s debt. I\nknew that he was staying at Halliday’s Private Hotel, and I hung about\nall day, but he never came out. I fancy that he suspected something\nwhen Drebber failed to put in an appearance. He was cunning, was\nStangerson, and always on his guard. If he thought he could keep me off\nby staying indoors he was very much mistaken. I soon found out which\nwas the window of his bedroom, and early next morning I took advantage\nof some ladders which were lying in the lane behind the hotel, and so\nmade my way into his room in the grey of the dawn. I woke him up and\ntold him that the hour had come when he was to answer for the life he\nhad taken so long before. I described Drebber’s death to him, and I\ngave him the same choice of the poisoned pills. Instead of grasping at\nthe chance of safety which that offered him, he sprang from his bed and\nflew at my throat. In self-defence I stabbed him to the heart. It would\nhave been the same in any case, for Providence would never have allowed\nhis guilty hand to pick out anything but the poison.",
      "“I have little more to say, and it’s as well, for I am about done up. I\nwent on cabbing it for a day or so, intending to keep at it until I\ncould save enough to take me back to America. I was standing in the\nyard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called\nJefferson Hope, and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at\n221B, Baker Street. I went round, suspecting no harm, and the next\nthing I knew, this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists, and\nas neatly shackled as ever I saw in my life. That’s the whole of my\nstory, gentlemen. You may consider me to be a murderer; but I hold that\nI am just as much an officer of justice as you are.”\n\nSo thrilling had the man’s narrative been, and his manner was so\nimpressive that we had sat silent and absorbed. Even the professional\ndetectives, _blasé_ as they were in every detail of crime, appeared to\nbe keenly interested in the man’s story. When he finished we sat for\nsome minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratching of\nLestrade’s pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his shorthand\naccount.\n\n“There is only one point on which I should like a little more\ninformation,” Sherlock Holmes said at last. “Who was your accomplice\nwho came for the ring which I advertised?”",
      "The prisoner winked at my friend jocosely. “I can tell my own secrets,”\nhe said, “but I don’t get other people into trouble. I saw your\nadvertisement, and I thought it might be a plant, or it might be the\nring which I wanted. My friend volunteered to go and see. I think\nyou’ll own he did it smartly.”\n\n“Not a doubt of that,” said Holmes heartily.\n\n“Now, gentlemen,” the Inspector remarked gravely, “the forms of the law\nmust be complied with. On Thursday the prisoner will be brought before\nthe magistrates, and your attendance will be required. Until then I\nwill be responsible for him.” He rang the bell as he spoke, and\nJefferson Hope was led off by a couple of warders, while my friend and\nI made our way out of the Station and took a cab back to Baker Street.\n\nCHAPTER VII.\nTHE CONCLUSION.\n\nWe had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the\nThursday; but when the Thursday came there was no occasion for our\ntestimony. A higher Judge had taken the matter in hand, and Jefferson\nHope had been summoned before a tribunal where strict justice would be\nmeted out to him. On the very night after his capture the aneurism\nburst, and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of the\ncell, with a placid smile upon his face, as though he had been able in\nhis dying moments to look back upon a useful life, and on work well\ndone.",
      "“Gregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death,” Holmes remarked,\nas we chatted it over next evening. “Where will their grand\nadvertisement be now?”\n\n“I don’t see that they had very much to do with his capture,” I\nanswered.\n\n“What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence,” returned my\ncompanion, bitterly. “The question is, what can you make people believe\nthat you have done. Never mind,” he continued, more brightly, after a\npause. “I would not have missed the investigation for anything. There\nhas been no better case within my recollection. Simple as it was, there\nwere several most instructive points about it.”\n\n“Simple!” I ejaculated.\n\n“Well, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise,” said Sherlock\nHolmes, smiling at my surprise. “The proof of its intrinsic simplicity\nis, that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions I was\nable to lay my hand upon the criminal within three days.”\n\n“That is true,” said I.",
      "“I have already explained to you that what is out of the common is\nusually a guide rather than a hindrance. In solving a problem of this\nsort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards. That is a very\nuseful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise\nit much. In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason\nforwards, and so the other comes to be neglected. There are fifty who\ncan reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically.”\n\n“I confess,” said I, “that I do not quite follow you.”\n\n“I hardly expected that you would. Let me see if I can make it clearer.\nMost people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you\nwhat the result would be. They can put those events together in their\nminds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. There are\nfew people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to\nevolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led\nup to that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning\nbackwards, or analytically.”\n\n“I understand,” said I.",
      "“Now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find\neverything else for yourself. Now let me endeavour to show you the\ndifferent steps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I\napproached the house, as you know, on foot, and with my mind entirely\nfree from all impressions. I naturally began by examining the roadway,\nand there, as I have already explained to you, I saw clearly the marks\nof a cab, which, I ascertained by inquiry, must have been there during\nthe night. I satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private\ncarriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels. The ordinary London growler\nis considerably less wide than a gentleman’s brougham.",
      "“This was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the garden\npath, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable\nfor taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere\ntrampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its\nsurface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective science which is\nso important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps.\nHappily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practice has\nmade it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks of the\nconstables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first\npassed through the garden. It was easy to tell that they had been\nbefore the others, because in places their marks had been entirely\nobliterated by the others coming upon the top of them. In this way my\nsecond link was formed, which told me that the nocturnal visitors were\ntwo in number, one remarkable for his height (as I calculated from the\nlength of his stride), and the other fashionably dressed, to judge from\nthe small and elegant impression left by his boots.",
      "“On entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My\nwell-booted man lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder,\nif murder there was. There was no wound upon the dead man’s person, but\nthe agitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen\nhis fate before it came upon him. Men who die from heart disease, or\nany sudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon\ntheir features. Having sniffed the dead man’s lips I detected a\nslightly sour smell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had\npoison forced upon him. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon\nhim from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face. By the method of\nexclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would\nmeet the facts. Do not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea. The\nforcible administration of poison is by no means a new thing in\ncriminal annals. The cases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of Leturier in\nMontpellier, will occur at once to any toxicologist.",
      "“And now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery had not\nbeen the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics,\nthen, or was it a woman? That was the question which confronted me. I\nwas inclined from the first to the latter supposition. Political\nassassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. This murder\nhad, on the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator\nhad left his tracks all over the room, showing that he had been there\nall the time. It must have been a private wrong, and not a political\none, which called for such a methodical revenge. When the inscription\nwas discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my\nopinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was found,\nhowever, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to\nremind his victim of some dead or absent woman. It was at this point\nthat I asked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to\nCleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber’s former career. He\nanswered, you remember, in the negative.",
      "“I then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which\nconfirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer’s height, and furnished\nme with the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the\nlength of his nails. I had already come to the conclusion, since there\nwere no signs of a struggle, that the blood which covered the floor had\nburst from the murderer’s nose in his excitement. I could perceive that\nthe track of blood coincided with the track of his feet. It is seldom\nthat any man, unless he is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way\nthrough emotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was\nprobably a robust and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that I had judged\ncorrectly.\n\n“Having left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. I\ntelegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry\nto the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber. The\nanswer was conclusive. It told me that Drebber had already applied for\nthe protection of the law against an old rival in love, named Jefferson\nHope, and that this same Hope was at present in Europe. I knew now that\nI held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to\nsecure the murderer.",
      "“I had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked\ninto the house with Drebber, was none other than the man who had driven\nthe cab. The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on\nin a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in\ncharge of it. Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside\nthe house? Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry\nout a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a third\nperson, who was sure to betray him. Lastly, supposing one man wished to\ndog another through London, what better means could he adopt than to\nturn cabdriver. All these considerations led me to the irresistible\nconclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the\nMetropolis.",
      "“If he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased\nto be. On the contrary, from his point of view, any sudden change would\nbe likely to draw attention to himself. He would, probably, for a time\nat least, continue to perform his duties. There was no reason to\nsuppose that he was going under an assumed name. Why should he change\nhis name in a country where no one knew his original one? I therefore\norganized my Street Arab detective corps, and sent them systematically\nto every cab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that\nI wanted. How well they succeeded, and how quickly I took advantage of\nit, are still fresh in your recollection. The murder of Stangerson was\nan incident which was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly in\nany case have been prevented. Through it, as you know, I came into\npossession of the pills, the existence of which I had already surmised.\nYou see the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a break\nor flaw.”\n\n“It is wonderful!” I cried. “Your merits should be publicly recognized.\nYou should publish an account of the case. If you won’t, I will for\nyou.”\n\n“You may do what you like, Doctor,” he answered. “See here!” he\ncontinued, handing a paper over to me, “look at this!”\n\nIt was the _Echo_ for the day, and the paragraph to which he pointed\nwas devoted to the case in question.",
      "“The public,” it said, “have lost a sensational treat through the\nsudden death of the man Hope, who was suspected of the murder of Mr.\nEnoch Drebber and of Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The details of the case\nwill probably be never known now, though we are informed upon good\nauthority that the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic\nfeud, in which love and Mormonism bore a part. It seems that both the\nvictims belonged, in their younger days, to the Latter Day Saints, and\nHope, the deceased prisoner, hails also from Salt Lake City. If the\ncase has had no other effect, it, at least, brings out in the most\nstriking manner the efficiency of our detective police force, and will\nserve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle\ntheir feuds at home, and not to carry them on to British soil. It is an\nopen secret that the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to\nthe well-known Scotland Yard officials, Messrs. Lestrade and Gregson.\nThe man was apprehended, it appears, in the rooms of a certain Mr.\nSherlock Holmes, who has himself, as an amateur, shown some talent in\nthe detective line, and who, with such instructors, may hope in time to\nattain to some degree of their skill. It is expected that a testimonial\nof some sort will be presented to the two officers as a fitting\nrecognition of their services.”",
      "“Didn’t I tell you so when we started?” cried Sherlock Holmes with a\nlaugh. “That’s the result of all our Study in Scarlet: to get them a\ntestimonial!”\n\n“Never mind,” I answered, “I have all the facts in my journal, and the\npublic shall know them. In the meantime you must make yourself\ncontented by the consciousness of success, like the Roman miser—\n\n“‘Populus me sibilat, at mihi plaudo\nIpse domi simul ac nummos contemplor in arca.’”"

      "Frankenstein;\n\nor, the Modern Prometheus\n\nby Mary Wollstonecraft (Godwin) Shelley\n\nCONTENTS\n\nLetter 1\n Letter 2\n Letter 3\n Letter 4\n Chapter 1\n Chapter 2\n Chapter 3\n Chapter 4\n Chapter 5\n Chapter 6\n Chapter 7\n Chapter 8\n Chapter 9\n Chapter 10\n Chapter 11\n Chapter 12\n Chapter 13\n Chapter 14\n Chapter 15\n Chapter 16\n Chapter 17\n Chapter 18\n Chapter 19\n Chapter 20\n Chapter 21\n Chapter 22\n Chapter 23\n Chapter 24\n\nLetter 1\n\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\n\nSt. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.\n\nYou will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the\ncommencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil\nforebodings. I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure\nmy dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success\nof my undertaking.",
      "I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of\nPetersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which\nbraces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this\nfeeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards\nwhich I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.\nInspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent\nand vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of\nfrost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the\nregion of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever\nvisible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a\nperpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put\nsome trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished;\nand, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in\nwonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable\nglobe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the\nphenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered\nsolitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I\nmay there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may\nregulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this\nvoyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I\nshall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world\nnever before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by\nthe foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to\nconquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this\nlaborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little\nboat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his\nnative river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you\ncannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all\nmankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole\nto those countries, to reach which at present so many months are\nrequisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at\nall possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.",
      "These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my\nletter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me\nto heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as\na steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual\neye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I\nhave read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have\nbeen made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean\nthrough the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a\nhistory of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the\nwhole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library. My education was neglected,\nyet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study\nday and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which\nI had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction\nhad forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.",
      "These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets\nwhose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also\nbecame a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;\nI imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the\nnames of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well\nacquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.\nBut just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my\nthoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.",
      "Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I\ncan, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this\ngreat enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I\naccompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea;\nI voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often\nworked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my\nnights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those\nbranches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive\nthe greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an\nunder-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I\nmust own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second\ndignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest\nearnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.",
      "And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?\nMy life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to\nevery enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging\nvoice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is\nfirm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am\nabout to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which\nwill demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits\nof others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.\n\nThis is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly\nquickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in\nmy opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The\ncold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I have\nalready adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the\ndeck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise\nprevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have no\nambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and\nArchangel.",
      "I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my\nintention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the\ninsurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary\namong those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to\nsail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how\ncan I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,\nwill pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon,\nor never.\n\nFarewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you,\nand save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your\nlove and kindness.\n\nYour affectionate brother,\n\nR. Walton\n\nLetter 2\n\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\n\nArchangel, 28th March, 17—.\n\nHow slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!\nYet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a\nvessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have\nalready engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly\npossessed of dauntless courage.",
      "But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the\nabsence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no\nfriend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there\nwill be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no\none will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts\nto paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of\nfeeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose\neyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I\nbitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet\ncourageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose\ntastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a\nfriend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution\nand too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me\nthat I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild\non a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages.\nAt that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own\ncountry; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its\nmost important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the\nnecessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native\ncountry. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many\nschoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my\ndaydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters\ncall it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense\nenough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to\nendeavour to regulate my mind.",
      "Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the\nwide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet\nsome feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these\nrugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage\nand enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase\nmore characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an\nEnglishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,\nunsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of\nhumanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;\nfinding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist\nin my enterprise.",
      "The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the\nship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This\ncircumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made\nme very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years\nspent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the\ngroundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to\nthe usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be\nnecessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness\nof heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt\nmyself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard\nof him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the\nhappiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved\na young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable\nsum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw\nhis mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in\ntears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,\nconfessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,\nand that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend\nreassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,\ninstantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his\nmoney, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he\nbestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his\nprize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young\nwoman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old\nman decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,\nwhen he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned\nuntil he heard that his former mistress was married according to her\ninclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He is\nso; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind\nof ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct\nthe more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which\notherwise he would command.",
      "Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can\nconceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am\nwavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage\nis only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The\nwinter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it\nis considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail\nsooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me\nsufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the\nsafety of others is committed to my care.",
      "I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my\nundertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of\nthe trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which\nI am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to “the\nland of mist and snow,” but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not\nbe alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and\nwoeful as the “Ancient Mariner.” You will smile at my allusion, but I\nwill disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my\npassionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that\nproduction of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something\nat work in my soul which I do not understand. I am practically\nindustrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and\nlabour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief\nin the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out\nof the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited\nregions I am about to explore.",
      "But to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after\nhaving traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of\nAfrica or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to\nlook on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to\nme by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when\nI need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. \nRemember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.\n\nYour affectionate brother,\n Robert Walton\n\nLetter 3\n\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\n\nJuly 7th, 17—.\n\nMy dear Sister,\n\nI write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe—and well advanced\non my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on\nits homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not\nsee my native land, perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good\nspirits: my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the\nfloating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers\nof the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We\nhave already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of\nsummer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales,\nwhich blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire\nto attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not\nexpected.",
      "No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a\nletter. One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are\naccidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and\nI shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.\n\nAdieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured that for my own sake, as well as\nyours, I will not rashly encounter danger. I will be cool,\npersevering, and prudent.\n\nBut success _shall_ crown my endeavours. Wherefore not? Thus far I\nhave gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars\nthemselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. Why not\nstill proceed over the untamed yet obedient element? What can stop the\ndetermined heart and resolved will of man?\n\nMy swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. But I must\nfinish. Heaven bless my beloved sister!\n\nR.W.\n\nLetter 4\n\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\n\nAugust 5th, 17—.\n\nSo strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear\nrecording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before\nthese papers can come into your possession.",
      "Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed\nin the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which\nshe floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we\nwere compassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to,\nhoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.\n\nAbout two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out\nin every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to\nhave no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to\ngrow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly\nattracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own\nsituation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by\ndogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a\nbeing which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,\nsat in the sledge and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress\nof the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the\ndistant inequalities of the ice.\n\nThis appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed,\nmany hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that\nit was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by\nice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the\ngreatest attention.",
      "About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before\nnight the ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the\nmorning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which\nfloat about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to\nrest for a few hours.\n\nIn the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and\nfound all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently\ntalking to someone in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we\nhad seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large\nfragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human\nbeing within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.\nHe was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of\nsome undiscovered island, but a European. When I appeared on deck the\nmaster said, “Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish\non the open sea.”\n\nOn perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a\nforeign accent. “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he,\n“will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?”",
      "You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed\nto me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have\nsupposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not\nhave exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I\nreplied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the\nnorthern pole.\n\nUpon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.\nGood God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for\nhis safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were\nnearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and\nsuffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted\nto carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh\nair he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the deck and\nrestored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to\nswallow a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life we\nwrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the\nkitchen stove. By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,\nwhich restored him wonderfully.",
      "Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often\nfeared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he\nhad in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and\nattended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more\ninteresting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of\nwildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone\nperforms an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most\ntrifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with\na beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he\nis generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his\nteeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.\n\nWhen my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off\nthe men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not\nallow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body\nand mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.\nOnce, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice\nin so strange a vehicle.\n\nHis countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and\nhe replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”\n\n“And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?”\n\n“Yes.”",
      "“Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we\nsaw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”\n\nThis aroused the stranger’s attention, and he asked a multitude of\nquestions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had\npursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, “I have,\ndoubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good\npeople; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”\n\n“Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to\ntrouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.”\n\n“And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have\nbenevolently restored me to life.”\n\nSoon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the\nice had destroyed the other sledge. I replied that I could not answer\nwith any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near\nmidnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety\nbefore that time; but of this I could not judge.",
      "From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the\nstranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for\nthe sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in\nthe cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.\nI have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant\nnotice if any new object should appear in sight.\n\nSuch is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the\npresent day. The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very\nsilent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.\nYet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all\ninterested in him, although they have had very little communication\nwith him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his\nconstant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must\nhave been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck\nso attractive and amiable.\n\nI said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend\non the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been\nbroken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother\nof my heart.\n\nI shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals,\nshould I have any fresh incidents to record.\n\nAugust 13th, 17—.",
      "My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my\nadmiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so\nnoble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant\ngrief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and\nwhen he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art,\nyet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.",
      "He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck,\napparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although\nunhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he\ninterests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently\nconversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without\ndisguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my\neventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken\nto secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the\nlanguage of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul\nand to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would\nsacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my\nenterprise. One man’s life or death were but a small price to pay for\nthe acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should\nacquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a\ndark gloom spread over my listener’s countenance. At first I\nperceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before\nhis eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle\nfast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I\npaused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: “Unhappy man! Do you\nshare my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me;\nlet me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!”",
      "Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the\nparoxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened\npowers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were\nnecessary to restore his composure.\n\nHaving conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise\nhimself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of\ndespair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He asked\nme the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it\nawakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a\nfriend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than\nhad ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could\nboast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.\n\n“I agree with you,” replied the stranger; “we are\nunfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than\nourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to\nperfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most\nnoble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting\nfriendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for\ndespair. But I—I have lost everything and cannot begin life\nanew.”",
      "As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled\ngrief that touched me to the heart. But he was silent and presently\nretired to his cabin.\n\nEven broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he\ndoes the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight\nafforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of\nelevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he\nmay suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he\nhas retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a\nhalo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.\n\nWill you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine\nwanderer? You would not if you saw him. You have been tutored and\nrefined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore\nsomewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to\nappreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. Sometimes I\nhave endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that\nelevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew. I\nbelieve it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing\npower of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled\nfor clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a\nvoice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.",
      "August 19th, 17—.\n\nYesterday the stranger said to me, “You may easily perceive, Captain\nWalton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had\ndetermined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with\nme, but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for\nknowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the\ngratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine\nhas been. I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be\nuseful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same\ncourse, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me\nwhat I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one\nthat may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you\nin case of failure. Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually\ndeemed marvellous. Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might\nfear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things\nwill appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would\nprovoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers\nof nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series\ninternal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.”",
      "You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered\ncommunication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by\na recital of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear\nthe promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong\ndesire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power. I expressed\nthese feelings in my answer.\n\n“I thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it is\nuseless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I\nshall repose in peace. I understand your feeling,” continued he,\nperceiving that I wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, my\nfriend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my\ndestiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is\ndetermined.”",
      "He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I\nshould be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have\nresolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to\nrecord, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during\nthe day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This\nmanuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who\nknow him, and who hear it from his own lips—with what interest and\nsympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I commence my\ntask, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me\nwith all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in\nanimation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul\nwithin. Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which\nembraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it—thus!\n\nChapter 1",
      "I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most\ndistinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years\ncounsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public\nsituations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who\nknew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public\nbusiness. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the\naffairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his\nmarrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a\nhusband and the father of a family.",
      "As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot\nrefrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a\nmerchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous\nmischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a\nproud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty\nand oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been\ndistinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts,\ntherefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his\ndaughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in\nwretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and\nwas deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.\nHe bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct\nso little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in\nendeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin\nthe world again through his credit and assistance.",
      "Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten\nmonths before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery,\nhe hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the\nReuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort\nhad saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but\nit was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in\nthe meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a\nmerchant’s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction;\nhis grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for\nreflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end\nof three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.\n\nHis daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw\nwith despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that\nthere was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort\npossessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support\nher in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw and\nby various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to\nsupport life.",
      "Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time\nwas more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence\ndecreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving\nher an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt\nby Beaufort’s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the\nchamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who\ncommitted herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he\nconducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a\nrelation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.",
      "There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but\nthis circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted\naffection. There was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mind\nwhich rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love\nstrongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the\nlate-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set\na greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and\nworship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the\ndoting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her\nvirtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing\nher for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace\nto his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes\nand her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is\nsheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her\nwith all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and\nbenevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto\nconstant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During\nthe two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had\ngradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after\ntheir union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change\nof scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,\nas a restorative for her weakened frame.",
      "From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born\nat Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained\nfor several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each\nother, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very\nmine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother’s tender caresses and\nmy father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my\nfirst recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something\nbetter—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on\nthem by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in\ntheir hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled\ntheir duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed\ntowards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit\nof tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during\nevery hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity,\nand of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but\none train of enjoyment to me.",
      "For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have a\ndaughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five\nyears old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they\npassed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent\ndisposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my\nmother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a\npassion—remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been\nrelieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the\nafflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale\nattracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number\nof half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst\nshape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother,\naccompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife,\nhard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to\nfive hungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted my mother far\nabove all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were\ndark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her\nhair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her\nclothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was\nclear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of\nher face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold\nher without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent,\nand bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.",
      "The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and\nadmiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was\nnot her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a\nGerman and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with\nthese good people to nurse: they were better off then. They had not been\nlong married, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of their\ncharge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory\nof Italy—one among the _schiavi ognor frementi,_ who exerted\nhimself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of its\nweakness. Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria\nwas not known. His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and\na beggar. She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude\nabode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.",
      "When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of\nour villa a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed\nto shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter\nthan the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his\npermission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their\ncharge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed\na blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty\nand want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They\nconsulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza\nbecame the inmate of my parents’ house—my more than\nsister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and\nmy pleasures.",
      "Everyone loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential\nattachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my\npride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being brought to\nmy home, my mother had said playfully, “I have a pretty present for my\nVictor—tomorrow he shall have it.” And when, on the morrow, she\npresented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish\nseriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth\nas mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on\nher I received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other\nfamiliarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could body\nforth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than\nsister, since till death she was to be mine only.\n\nChapter 2",
      "We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in\nour ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of\ndisunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and\nthe diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us\nnearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated\ndisposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense\napplication and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.\nShe busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets;\nand in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss\nhome —the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons,\ntempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of\nour Alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight.\nWhile my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the\nmagnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their\ncauses. The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.\nCuriosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature,\ngladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the\nearliest sensations I can remember.",
      "On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave\nup entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native\ncountry. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a _campagne_ on Belrive,\nthe eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a\nleague from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and the\nlives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my\ntemper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was\nindifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united\nmyself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry\nClerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular\ntalent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for\nits own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He\ncomposed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and\nknightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into\nmasquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of\nRoncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous\ntrain who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands\nof the infidels.",
      "No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My\nparents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.\nWe felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to\ntheir caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights\nwhich we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families I distinctly\ndiscerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted\nthe development of filial love.\n\nMy temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some\nlaw in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits\nbut to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things\nindiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages,\nnor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states\npossessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth\nthat I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of\nthings or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man\nthat occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical,\nor in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.",
      "Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral\nrelations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes,\nand the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was\nto become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the\ngallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly soul\nof Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.\nHer sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of\nher celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was\nthe living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become\nsullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that\nshe was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And\nClerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval? Yet\nhe might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his\ngenerosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for\nadventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of\nbeneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring\nambition.",
      "I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood,\nbefore misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of\nextensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides,\nin drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which\nled, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would\naccount to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my\ndestiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost\nforgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent\nwhich, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.",
      "Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire,\ntherefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my\npredilection for that science. When I was thirteen years of age we all went\non a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the\nweather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I\nchanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it\nwith apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful\nfacts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new\nlight seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my\ndiscovery to my father. My father looked carelessly at the title page of my\nbook and said, “Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste\nyour time upon this; it is sad trash.”",
      "If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me\nthat the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern\nsystem of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers\nthan the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while\nthose of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I\nshould certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my\nimagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my\nformer studies. It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never\nhave received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin. But the cursory glance\nmy father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was\nacquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatest\navidity.",
      "When I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this\nauthor, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and\nstudied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me\ntreasures known to few besides myself. I have described myself as always\nhaving been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of\nnature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern\nphilosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.\nSir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking\nup shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his\nsuccessors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted\nappeared even to my boy’s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same\npursuit.\n\nThe untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted\nwith their practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little\nmore. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal\nlineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect,\nanatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes\nin their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. I\nhad gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep\nhuman beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and\nignorantly I had repined.",
      "But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew\nmore. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their\ndisciple. It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth\ncentury; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of\nGeneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite\nstudies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a\nchild’s blindness, added to a student’s thirst for knowledge.\nUnder the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest\ndiligence into the search of the philosopher’s stone and the elixir\nof life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. Wealth was an\ninferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could\nbanish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but\na violent death!",
      "Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a\npromise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which\nI most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I\nattributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a\nwant of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus for a time I was\noccupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand\ncontradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of\nmultifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish\nreasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.",
      "When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near\nBelrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. It\nadvanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once\nwith frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained,\nwhile the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.\nAs I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an\nold and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so\nsoon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing\nremained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning, we found\nthe tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the\nshock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. I never beheld\nanything so utterly destroyed.",
      "Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of\nelectricity. On this occasion a man of great research in natural\nphilosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on\nthe explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of\nelectricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.\nAll that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa,\nAlbertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by\nsome fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my\naccustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever\nbe known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew\ndespicable. By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps\nmost subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former\noccupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed\nand abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a\nwould-be science which could never even step within the threshold of\nreal knowledge. In this mood of mind I betook myself to the\nmathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as\nbeing built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.",
      "Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments\nare we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to me\nas if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the\nimmediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life—the last effort\nmade by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even\nthen hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me. Her victory was\nannounced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which\nfollowed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting\nstudies. It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with\ntheir prosecution, happiness with their disregard.\n\nIt was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual.\nDestiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and\nterrible destruction.\n\nChapter 3\n\nWhen I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I\nshould become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had\nhitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it\nnecessary for the completion of my education that I should be made\nacquainted with other customs than those of my native country. My\ndeparture was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day\nresolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life\noccurred—an omen, as it were, of my future misery.",
      "Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was\nin the greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been urged to\npersuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had at first\nyielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her\nfavourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She\nattended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity\nof the distemper—Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this\nimprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mother\nsickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the\nlooks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her\ndeathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert\nher. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. “My\nchildren,” she said, “my firmest hopes of future happiness were\nplaced on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the\nconsolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to\nmy younger children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy\nand beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But these are\nnot thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to\ndeath and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.”",
      "She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.\nI need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent\nby that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the\nsoul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so\nlong before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day\nand whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed\nfor ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been\nextinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear\ncan be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of\nthe first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the\nevil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has\nnot that rude hand rent away some dear connection? And why should I\ndescribe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at\nlength arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and\nthe smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a\nsacrilege, is not banished. My mother was dead, but we had still\nduties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the\nrest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the\nspoiler has not seized.",
      "My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events,\nwas now again determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of\nsome weeks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose,\nakin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of\nlife. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I was\nunwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above\nall, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.\n\nShe indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.\nShe looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and\nzeal. She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call\nher uncle and cousins. Never was she so enchanting as at this time,\nwhen she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.\nShe forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.",
      "The day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the last\nevening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit\nhim to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain. His\nfather was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the\naspirations and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune\nof being debarred from a liberal education. He said little, but when\nhe spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a\nrestrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details\nof commerce.\n\nWe sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor\npersuade ourselves to say the word “Farewell!” It was said, and we\nretired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the\nother was deceived; but when at morning’s dawn I descended to the\ncarriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my father\nagain to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to\nrenew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last\nfeminine attentions on her playmate and friend.",
      "I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in\nthe most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by\namiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual\npleasure—I was now alone. In the university whither I was going I\nmust form my own friends and be my own protector. My life had hitherto\nbeen remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible\nrepugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and\nClerval; these were “old familiar faces,” but I believed myself\ntotally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as\nI commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I\nardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home,\nthought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had\nlonged to enter the world and take my station among other human beings. \nNow my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to\nrepent.\n\nI had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my\njourney to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the\nhigh white steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted and was\nconducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.",
      "The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to\nsome of the principal professors. Chance—or rather the evil\ninfluence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me\nfrom the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father’s\ndoor—led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He\nwas an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He\nasked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches\nof science appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied carelessly, and\npartly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal\nauthors I had studied. The professor stared. “Have you,” he\nsaid, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?”\n\nI replied in the affirmative. “Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with\nwarmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly\nand entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems\nand useless names. Good God! In what desert land have you lived,\nwhere no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you\nhave so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they\nare ancient? I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific\nage, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear\nsir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.”",
      "So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books\ntreating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and\ndismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following\nweek he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural\nphilosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow\nprofessor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he\nomitted.",
      "I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long\nconsidered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I\nreturned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any\nshape. M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a\nrepulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in\nfavour of his pursuits. In rather a too philosophical and connected a\nstrain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come\nto concerning them in my early years. As a child I had not been\ncontent with the results promised by the modern professors of natural\nscience. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my\nextreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the\nsteps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the\ndiscoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.\nBesides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.\nIt was very different when the masters of the science sought\nimmortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now\nthe scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit\nitself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in\nscience was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of\nboundless grandeur for realities of little worth.",
      "Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my\nresidence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming\nacquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new\nabode. But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information\nwhich M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although I\ncould not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver\nsentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.\nWaldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.",
      "Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing\nroom, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very\nunlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an\naspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his\ntemples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person\nwas short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.\nHe began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and\nthe various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing\nwith fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took\na cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of\nits elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he\nconcluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I\nshall never forget:",
      "“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he,\n“promised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters\npromise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that\nthe elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem\nonly made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or\ncrucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses\nof nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend into the\nheavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of\nthe air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers;\nthey can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even\nmock the invisible world with its own shadows.”\n\nSuch were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of\nthe fate—enounced to destroy me. As he went on I felt as if my soul\nwere grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were\ntouched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was\nsounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,\none purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of\nFrankenstein—more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps\nalready marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and\nunfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.",
      "I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of\ninsurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I\nhad no power to produce it. By degrees, after the morning’s dawn,\nsleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream.\nThere only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to\ndevote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a\nnatural talent. On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit. His\nmanners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,\nfor there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in\nhis own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I\ngave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had\ngiven to his fellow professor. He heard with attention the little\nnarration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius\nAgrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had\nexhibited. He said that “These were men to whose indefatigable zeal\nmodern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their\nknowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names\nand arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a\ngreat degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The\nlabours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever\nfail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.” I\nlistened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption\nor affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my\nprejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured\nterms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his\ninstructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have\nmade me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended\nlabours. I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to\nprocure.",
      "“I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a\ndisciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of\nyour success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the\ngreatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that\nI have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not\nneglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry\nchemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your\nwish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty\nexperimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural\nphilosophy, including mathematics.”\n\nHe then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his\nvarious machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and\npromising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in\nthe science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of\nbooks which I had requested, and I took my leave.\n\nThus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.\n\nChapter 4",
      "From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the\nmost comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.\nI read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,\nwhich modern inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the\nlectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the\nuniversity, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense\nand real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive\nphysiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In\nM. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by\ndogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and\ngood nature that banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand ways\nhe smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse\ninquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was at\nfirst fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and\nsoon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the\nlight of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.",
      "As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress\nwas rapid. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and\nmy proficiency that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me,\nwith a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman\nexpressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years\npassed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was\nengaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I\nhoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can conceive\nof the enticements of science. In other studies you go as far as\nothers have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in\na scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.\nA mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must\ninfallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who\ncontinually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was\nsolely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two\nyears I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical\ninstruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the\nuniversity. When I had arrived at this point and had become as well\nacquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as\ndepended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my\nresidence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought\nof returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident\nhappened that protracted my stay.",
      "One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was\nthe structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with\nlife. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?\nIt was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a\nmystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming\nacquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our\ninquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined\nthenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of\nnatural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been\nanimated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this\nstudy would have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the\ncauses of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became\nacquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I\nmust also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.\nIn my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my\nmind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever\nremember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared\nthe apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and\na churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of\nlife, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become\nfood for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of\nthis decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and\ncharnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most\ninsupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the\nfine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of\ndeath succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm\ninherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and\nanalysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change\nfrom life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this\ndarkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and\nwondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity\nof the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so\nmany men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same\nscience, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a\nsecret.",
      "Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not\nmore certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is\ntrue. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the\ndiscovery were distinct and probable. After days and nights of\nincredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of\ngeneration and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing\nanimation upon lifeless matter.\n\nThe astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery\nsoon gave place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in\npainful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the\nmost gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so\ngreat and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been\nprogressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.\nWhat had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation\nof the world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it\nall opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a\nnature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them\ntowards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already\naccomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead\nand found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly\nineffectual light.",
      "I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes\nexpress, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with\nwhich I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end\nof my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that\nsubject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was,\nto your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my\nprecepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of\nknowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town\nto be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature\nwill allow.",
      "When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated\na long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.\nAlthough I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to\nprepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of\nfibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable\ndifficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the\ncreation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my\nimagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to\ndoubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful\nas man. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared\nadequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should\nultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my\noperations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be\nimperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes\nplace in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present\nattempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Nor\ncould I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any\nargument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I\nbegan the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts\nformed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first\nintention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,\nabout eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After having\nformed this determination and having spent some months in successfully\ncollecting and arranging my materials, I began.",
      "No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like\na hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death\nappeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and\npour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless\nme as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would\nowe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his\nchild so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these\nreflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless\nmatter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)\nrenew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.",
      "These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking\nwith unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my\nperson had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very\nbrink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the\nnext day or the next hour might realise. One secret which I alone\npossessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon\ngazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless\neagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive\nthe horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps\nof the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless\nclay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but\nthen a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed\nto have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was\nindeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed\nacuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had\nreturned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses and\ndisturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human\nframe. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,\nand separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,\nI kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from\ntheir sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The\ndissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;\nand often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,\nwhilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I\nbrought my work near to a conclusion.",
      "The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in\none pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields\nbestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant\nvintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the\nsame feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also\nto forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had\nnot seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them, and I\nwell remembered the words of my father: “I know that while you are\npleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall\nhear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any\ninterruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties\nare equally neglected.”\n\nI knew well therefore what would be my father’s feelings, but I could\nnot tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which\nhad taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it\nwere, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection\nuntil the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature,\nshould be completed.",
      "I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect\nto vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was\njustified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from\nblame. A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and\npeaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to\ndisturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge\nis an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself\nhas a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for\nthose simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that\nstudy is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human\nmind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit\nwhatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic\naffections, Greece had not been enslaved, Cæsar would have spared his\ncountry, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the\nempires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.\n\nBut I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my\ntale, and your looks remind me to proceed.",
      "My father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my\nsilence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.\nWinter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not\nwatch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before always\nyielded me supreme delight—so deeply was I engrossed in my\noccupation. The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near\nto a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had\nsucceeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared\nrather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other\nunwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.\nEvery night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most\npainful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow\ncreatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at\nthe wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone\nsustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and\namusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself\nboth of these when my creation should be complete.\n\nChapter 5",
      "It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment\nof my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I\ncollected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a\nspark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was\nalready one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the\npanes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the\nhalf-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature\nopen; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.\n\nHow can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate\nthe wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to\nform? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as\nbeautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered\nthe work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous\nblack, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these\nluxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,\nthat seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which\nthey were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.",
      "The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings\nof human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole\npurpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had\ndeprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour\nthat far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty\nof the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my\nheart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I\nrushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my\nbed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude\nsucceeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the\nbed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.\nBut it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest\ndreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in\nthe streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her,\nbut as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with\nthe hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I\nheld the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her\nform, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.\nI started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my\nteeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and\nyellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window\nshutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I had\ncreated. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they\nmay be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some\ninarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have\nspoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to\ndetain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the\ncourtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained\nduring the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest\nagitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if\nit were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I\nhad so miserably given life.",
      "Oh! No mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy\nagain endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I\nhad gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those\nmuscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing\nsuch as even Dante could not have conceived.\n\nI passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and\nhardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly\nsank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with\nthis horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had\nbeen my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a\nhell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!\n\nMorning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my\nsleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple\nand clock, which indicated the sixth hour. The porter opened the gates\nof the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into\nthe streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the\nwretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my\nview. I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but\nfelt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured\nfrom a black and comfortless sky.",
      "I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by\nbodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I\ntraversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or\nwhat I was doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I\nhurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:\n \n Like one who, on a lonely road,\n Doth walk in fear and dread,\n And, having once turned round, walks on,\n And turns no more his head;\n Because he knows a frightful fiend\n Doth close behind him tread.\n \n [Coleridge’s “Ancient Mariner.”]\n\nContinuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various\ndiligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why;\nbut I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming\ntowards me from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer I observed\nthat it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and\non the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me,\ninstantly sprung out. “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he,\n“how glad I am to see you! How fortunate that you should be here at\nthe very moment of my alighting!”",
      "Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back\nto my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear\nto my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror\nand misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months,\ncalm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial\nmanner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval continued talking for\nsome time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being\npermitted to come to Ingolstadt. “You may easily believe,” said\nhe, “how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all\nnecessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping;\nand, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant\nanswer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch\nschoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: ‘I have ten thousand florins\na year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.’ But his\naffection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has\npermitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of\nknowledge.”\n\n“It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left\nmy father, brothers, and Elizabeth.”",
      "“Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from\nyou so seldom. By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their\naccount myself. But, my dear Frankenstein,” continued he, stopping\nshort and gazing full in my face, “I did not before remark how very ill\nyou appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for\nseveral nights.”\n\n“You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one\noccupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see;\nbut I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an\nend and that I am at length free.”",
      "I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to\nallude to, the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a\nquick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and\nthe thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my\napartment might still be there, alive and walking about. I dreaded to\nbehold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.\nEntreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the\nstairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand was already on the\nlock of the door before I recollected myself. I then paused, and a\ncold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly open, as\nchildren are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in\nwaiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped\nfearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed\nfrom its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good\nfortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy\nhad indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.",
      "We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;\nbut I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed\nme; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse\nbeat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same\nplace; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.\nClerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival,\nbut when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes\nfor which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless\nlaughter frightened and astonished him.\n\n“My dear Victor,” cried he, “what, for God’s sake,\nis the matter? Do not laugh in that manner. How ill you are! What is the\ncause of all this?”\n\n“Do not ask me,” cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I\nthought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; “_he_ can\ntell. Oh, save me! Save me!” I imagined that the monster seized me;\nI struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.\n\nPoor Clerval! What must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he\nanticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I\nwas not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not\nrecover my senses for a long, long time.",
      "This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for\nseveral months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I\nafterwards learned that, knowing my father’s advanced age and unfitness\nfor so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make\nElizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my\ndisorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive\nnurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he\ndid not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest\naction that he could towards them.\n\nBut I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and\nunremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.\nThe form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever\nbefore my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my\nwords surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings\nof my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I\ncontinually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder\nindeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.",
      "By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and\ngrieved my friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became\ncapable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I\nperceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young\nbuds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was\na divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my\nconvalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in\nmy bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as\ncheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.\n\n“Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I, “how kind, how very good\nyou are to me. This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you\npromised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever\nrepay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I\nhave been the occasion, but you will forgive me.”\n\n“You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get\nwell as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I\nmay speak to you on one subject, may I not?”\n\nI trembled. One subject! What could it be? Could he allude to an object on\nwhom I dared not even think?",
      "“Compose yourself,” said Clerval, who observed my change of\ncolour, “I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father\nand cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your\nown handwriting. They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at\nyour long silence.”\n\n“Is that all, my dear Henry? How could you suppose that my first\nthought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and\nwho are so deserving of my love?”\n\n“If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad\nto see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from\nyour cousin, I believe.”\n\nChapter 6\n\nClerval then put the following letter into my hands. It was from my\nown Elizabeth:\n\n“My dearest Cousin,",
      "“You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear\nkind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account. You are\nforbidden to write—to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor,\nis necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long time I have thought\nthat each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have\nrestrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have\nprevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so\nlong a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to\nperform it myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending on\nyour sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never\nguess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of\nyour poor cousin. Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed\nyou are getting better. I eagerly hope that you will confirm this\nintelligence soon in your own handwriting.",
      "“Get well—and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home and\nfriends who love you dearly. Your father’s health is vigorous, and he\nasks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a\ncare will ever cloud his benevolent countenance. How pleased you would\nbe to remark the improvement of our Ernest! He is now sixteen and full\nof activity and spirit. He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter\ninto foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his\nelder brother returns to us. My uncle is not pleased with the idea of\na military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your\npowers of application. He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his\ntime is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the\nlake. I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point\nand permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.",
      "“Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken\nplace since you left us. The blue lake and snow-clad mountains—they\nnever change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are\nregulated by the same immutable laws. My trifling occupations take up\nmy time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing\nnone but happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, but one\nchange has taken place in our little household. Do you remember on\nwhat occasion Justine Moritz entered our family? Probably you do not;\nI will relate her history, therefore in a few words. Madame Moritz,\nher mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the\nthird. This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but\nthrough a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and\nafter the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed\nthis, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother\nto allow her to live at our house. The republican institutions of our\ncountry have produced simpler and happier manners than those which\nprevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less\ndistinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the\nlower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are\nmore refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same\nthing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in\nour family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our\nfortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a\nsacrifice of the dignity of a human being.",
      "“Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I\nrecollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one\nglance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that\nAriosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica—she looked so\nfrank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her,\nby which she was induced to give her an education superior to that\nwhich she had at first intended. This benefit was fully repaid;\nJustine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not\nmean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but\nyou could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.\nAlthough her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,\nyet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. She\nthought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her\nphraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.\n\n“When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own\ngrief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness\nwith the most anxious affection. Poor Justine was very ill; but other\ntrials were reserved for her.",
      "“One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the\nexception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The\nconscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the\ndeaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her\npartiality. She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor\nconfirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few months\nafter your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her\nrepentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she quitted our house; she\nwas much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness\nand a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable\nfor vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mother’s house of a nature\nto restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in her\nrepentance. She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness,\nbut much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her\nbrothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz\ninto a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is\nnow at peace for ever. She died on the first approach of cold weather,\nat the beginning of this last winter. Justine has just returned to us;\nand I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle,\nand extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her\nexpression continually remind me of my dear aunt.",
      "“I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling\nWilliam. I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with\nsweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair. When he\nsmiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with\nhealth. He has already had one or two little _wives,_ but Louisa Biron\nis his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.\n\n“Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little\ngossip concerning the good people of Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansfield\nhas already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching\nmarriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly\nsister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Your\nfavourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes\nsince the departure of Clerval from Geneva. But he has already\nrecovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a\nlively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow, and much\nolder than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with\neverybody.",
      "“I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety\nreturns upon me as I conclude. Write, dearest Victor,—one line—one\nword will be a blessing to us. Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his\nkindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely\ngrateful. Adieu! my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I entreat\nyou, write!\n\n“Elizabeth Lavenza.\n\n“Geneva, March 18th, 17—.”\n\n“Dear, dear Elizabeth!” I exclaimed, when I had read her\nletter: “I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety\nthey must feel.” I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but\nmy convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. In another\nfortnight I was able to leave my chamber.",
      "One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the\nseveral professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a\nkind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had\nsustained. Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the\nbeginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even\nto the name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored\nto health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony\nof my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all my\napparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for he\nperceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had\npreviously been my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of\nno avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture\nwhen he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I\nhad made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the\nsubject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to\nmodesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science\nitself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What\ncould I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he\nhad placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which\nwere to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I\nwrithed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.\nClerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the\nsensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his\ntotal ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. I\nthanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly\nthat he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from\nme; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence\nthat knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in\nhim that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which\nI feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.",
      "M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of\nalmost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even\nmore pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. “D—n\nthe fellow!” cried he; “why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has\noutstript us all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A\nyoungster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly\nas in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if\nhe is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.—Ay,\nay,” continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering,\n“M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.\nYoung men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was\nmyself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.”\n\nM. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned\nthe conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.",
      "Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his\nliterary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He\ncame to the university with the design of making himself complete\nmaster of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for\nthe plan of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no\ninglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording\nscope for his spirit of enterprise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit\nlanguages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on\nthe same studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I\nwished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt\ngreat relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not\nonly instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. I\ndid not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for\nI did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary\namusement. I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well\nrepaid my labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy\nelevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of\nany other country. When you read their writings, life appears to\nconsist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,—in the smiles and frowns\nof a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How\ndifferent from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!",
      "Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was\nfixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several\naccidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable,\nand my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. I felt this\ndelay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved\nfriends. My return had only been delayed so long, from an\nunwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become\nacquainted with any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent\ncheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came\nits beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.\n\nThe month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily\nwhich was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a\npedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a\npersonal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited. I acceded\nwith pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval\nhad always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature\nthat I had taken among the scenes of my native country.",
      "We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits\nhad long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the\nsalubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and\nthe conversation of my friend. Study had before secluded me from the\nintercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but\nClerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught\nme to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.\nExcellent friend! how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to\nelevate my mind until it was on a level with your own. A selfish\npursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and\naffection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature\nwho, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.\nWhen happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most\ndelightful sensations. A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with\necstasy. The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring\nbloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud. I\nwas undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed\nupon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an\ninvincible burden.",
      "Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he\nexerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled\nhis soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly\nastonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in\nimitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful\nfancy and passion. At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew\nme out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.\n\nWe returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were\ndancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits were\nhigh, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.\n\nChapter 7\n\nOn my return, I found the following letter from my father:—\n\n“My dear Victor,",
      "“You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of\nyour return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few\nlines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But\nthat would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be\nyour surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to\nbehold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can\nI relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have rendered you callous to\nour joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent\nson? I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is\nimpossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words\nwhich are to convey to you the horrible tidings.\n\n“William is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed\nmy heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered!\n\n“I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the\ncircumstances of the transaction.",
      "“Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to\nwalk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged\nour walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of\nreturning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone\non before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until\nthey should return. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen\nhis brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William\nhad run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and\nafterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.\n\n“This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him\nuntil night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have\nreturned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with\ntorches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had\nlost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night;\nElizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning I\ndiscovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and\nactive in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the\nprint of the murder’s finger was on his neck.",
      "“He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my\ncountenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to\nsee the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted,\nand entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the\nvictim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, ‘O God! I have murdered my\ndarling child!’\n\n“She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again\nlived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same\nevening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable\nminiature that she possessed of your mother. This picture is gone, and\nwas doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. We\nhave no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him\nare unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!\n\n“Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps\ncontinually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death;\nher words pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but will not that be an\nadditional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?\nYour dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live\nto witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!",
      "“Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin,\nbut with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of\nfestering, the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my\nfriend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not\nwith hatred for your enemies.\n\n“Your affectionate and afflicted father,\n\n“Alphonse Frankenstein.\n\n“Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”\n\nClerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was\nsurprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at first\nexpressed on receiving news from my friends. I threw the letter on the\ntable, and covered my face with my hands.\n\n“My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me\nweep with bitterness, “are you always to be unhappy? My dear friend,\nwhat has happened?”\n\nI motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the\nroom in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of\nClerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.\n\n“I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he;\n“your disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?”\n\n“To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.”",
      "During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation;\nhe could only express his heartfelt sympathy. “Poor William!” said he,\n“dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who that had\nseen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his\nuntimely loss! To die so miserably; to feel the murderer’s grasp! How\nmuch more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence! Poor little\nfellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but\nhe is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.\nA sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer\nbe a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable\nsurvivors.”\n\nClerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words\nimpressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in\nsolitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a\ncabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.",
      "My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed\nto console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I\ndrew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain\nthe multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through\nscenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years.\nHow altered every thing might be during that time! One sudden and\ndesolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances\nmight have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were\ndone more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I\ndared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble,\nalthough I was unable to define them.\n\nI remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I\ncontemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the\nsnowy mountains, “the palaces of nature,” were not changed. By\ndegrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey\ntowards Geneva.",
      "The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I\napproached my native town. I discovered more distinctly the black\nsides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc. I wept like a\nchild. “Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your\nwanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and\nplacid. Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?”\n\nI fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on\nthese preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative\nhappiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved\ncountry! who but a native can tell the delight I took in again\nbeholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely\nlake!\n\nYet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also\nclosed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still\nmore gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I\nforesaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human\nbeings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single\ncircumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not\nconceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.",
      "It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates\nof the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at\nSecheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. The sky\nwas serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot\nwhere my poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass through the\ntown, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.\nDuring this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont\nBlanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach\nrapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its\nprogress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain\ncoming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.",
      "I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm\nincreased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash\nover my head. It was echoed from Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of\nSavoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the\nlake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant\nevery thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself\nfrom the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in\nSwitzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The\nmost violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the\nlake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of\nCopêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another\ndarkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain to the\neast of the lake.",
      "While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with\na hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my\nhands, and exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel! this is thy\nfuneral, this thy dirge!” As I said these words, I perceived in the\ngloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood\nfixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning\nilluminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its\ngigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs\nto humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy\ndæmon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I\nshuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that\nidea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth\nchattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure\npassed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could\nhave destroyed the fair child. _He_ was the murderer! I could not\ndoubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the\nfact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for\nanother flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly\nperpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the\nsouth. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.",
      "I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still\ncontinued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I\nrevolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget:\nthe whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of\nthe works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure. Two years had\nnow nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and\nwas this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world a\ndepraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not\nmurdered my brother?\n\nNo one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the\nnight, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not\nfeel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in\nscenes of evil and despair. I considered the being whom I had cast\namong mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes\nof horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light\nof my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced\nto destroy all that was dear to me.",
      "Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were\nopen, and I hastened to my father’s house. My first thought was to\ndiscover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be\nmade. But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A\nbeing whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at\nmidnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I\nremembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at\nthe time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of\ndelirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that\nif any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have\nlooked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature\nof the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited\nas to persuade my relatives to commence it. And then of what use would\nbe pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the\noverhanging sides of Mont Salêve? These reflections determined me, and\nI resolved to remain silent.\n\nIt was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house. I\ntold the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library\nto attend their usual hour of rising.",
      "Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I\nstood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my\ndeparture for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained\nto me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the\nmantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my father’s\ndesire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling\nby the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale;\nbut there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the\nsentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my\ntears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest\nentered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:\n“Welcome, my dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you\nhad come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and\ndelighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can\nalleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems\nsinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor\nElizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—Poor\nWilliam! he was our darling and our pride!”",
      "Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortal\nagony crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagined the\nwretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and\na not less terrible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more\nminutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.\n\n“She most of all,” said Ernest, “requires consolation; she accused\nherself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her\nvery wretched. But since the murderer has been discovered—”\n\n“The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt\nto pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the\nwinds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he\nwas free last night!”\n\n“I do not know what you mean,” replied my brother, in accents of\nwonder, “but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery. No\none would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be\nconvinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit\nthat Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family,\ncould suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?”\n\n“Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is\nwrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?”",
      "“No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have\nalmost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so\nconfused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear,\nleaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried today, and you will\nthen hear all.”\n\nHe then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William\nhad been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her\nbed for several days. During this interval, one of the servants,\nhappening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the\nmurder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which\nhad been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant\ninstantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to\nany of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition,\nJustine was apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the poor girl\nconfirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of\nmanner.\n\nThis was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied\nearnestly, “You are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor,\ngood Justine, is innocent.”",
      "At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed\non his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,\nafter we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced\nsome other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed,\n“Good God, papa! Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of\npoor William.”\n\n“We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father, “for indeed I had\nrather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much\ndepravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.”\n\n“My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”\n\n“If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be\ntried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.”\n\nThis speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that\nJustine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I\nhad no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be\nbrought forward strong enough to convict her. My tale was not one to\nannounce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as\nmadness by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist, except I, the\ncreator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the\nexistence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance\nwhich I had let loose upon the world?",
      "We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I last\nbeheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of\nher childish years. There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but\nit was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.\nShe welcomed me with the greatest affection. “Your arrival, my dear\ncousin,” said she, “fills me with hope. You perhaps will find some\nmeans to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she\nbe convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do\nupon my own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only\nlost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely\nlove, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I\nnever shall know joy more. But she will not, I am sure she will not;\nand then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little\nWilliam.”\n\n“She is innocent, my Elizabeth,” said I, “and that shall\nbe proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance\nof her acquittal.”\n\n“How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt,\nand that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to\nsee every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me\nhopeless and despairing.” She wept.",
      "“Dearest niece,” said my father, “dry your tears. If she\nis, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the\nactivity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of\npartiality.”\n\nChapter 8\n\nWe passed a few sad hours until eleven o’clock, when the trial was to\ncommence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend\nas witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of\nthis wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture. It was to\nbe decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would\ncause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of\ninnocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every\naggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.\nJustine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised\nto render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an\nignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I\nhave confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I\nwas absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have\nbeen considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have\nexculpated her who suffered through me.",
      "The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning, and\nher countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her\nfeelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in\ninnocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by\nthousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have\nexcited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the\nimagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She\nwas tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as\nher confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she\nworked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the\ncourt she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were\nseated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly\nrecovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest\nher utter guiltlessness.",
      "The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the\ncharge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined\nagainst her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof\nof her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on\nwhich the murder had been committed and towards morning had been\nperceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the\nmurdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked her what she\ndid there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused\nand unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight\no’clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she\nreplied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly\nif anything had been heard concerning him. When shown the body, she\nfell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. The\npicture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;\nand when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same\nwhich, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round\nhis neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.",
      "Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her\ncountenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly\nexpressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was\ndesired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible\nalthough variable voice.\n\n“God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am innocent. But I\ndo not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence\non a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced\nagainst me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my\njudges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears\ndoubtful or suspicious.”",
      "She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed\nthe evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the\nhouse of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a league from\nGeneva. On her return, at about nine o’clock, she met a man who asked\nher if she had seen anything of the child who was lost. She was\nalarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him,\nwhen the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain\nseveral hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being\nunwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. Most\nof the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that\nshe slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.\nIt was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour\nto find my brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay,\nit was without her knowledge. That she had been bewildered when\nquestioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed\na sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.\nConcerning the picture she could give no account.",
      "“I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and\nfatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of\nexplaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left\nto conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been\nplaced in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have no\nenemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me\nwantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity\nafforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the\njewel, to part with it again so soon?\n\n“I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for\nhope. I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my\ncharacter, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed\nguilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my\ninnocence.”\n\nSeveral witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and\nthey spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they\nsupposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come\nforward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent\ndispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,\nwhen, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address\nthe court.",
      "“I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child who\nwas murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived\nwith his parents ever since and even long before his birth. It may\ntherefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but\nwhen I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her\npretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I\nknow of her character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived\nin the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly\ntwo years. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and\nbenevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in\nher last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards\nattended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited\nthe admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my\nuncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was\nwarmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a\nmost affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that,\nnotwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely\non her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such an action; as to\nthe bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it,\nI should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value\nher.”",
      "A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth’s simple and powerful\nappeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in\nfavour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with\nrenewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. She\nherself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. My own\nagitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. I believed\nin her innocence; I knew it. Could the dæmon who had (I did not for a\nminute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have\nbetrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? I could not sustain the\nhorror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and\nthe countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim,\nI rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the accused did\nnot equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of\nremorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.\n\nI passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to\nthe court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal\nquestion, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my\nvisit. The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine\nwas condemned.",
      "I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before\nexperienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon\nthem adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the\nheart-sickening despair that I then endured. The person to whom I\naddressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt.\n“That evidence,” he observed, “was hardly required in so glaring a\ncase, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to\ncondemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so\ndecisive.”\n\nThis was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? Had\nmy eyes deceived me? And was I really as mad as the whole world would\nbelieve me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions? I\nhastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.\n\n“My cousin,” replied I, “it is decided as you may have expected; all\njudges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty\nshould escape. But she has confessed.”\n\nThis was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon\nJustine’s innocence. “Alas!” said she. “How shall I\never again believe in human goodness? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as\nmy sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?\nHer mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has\ncommitted a murder.”",
      "Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my\ncousin. My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own\njudgment and feelings to decide. “Yes,” said Elizabeth,\n“I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany\nme; I cannot go alone.” The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet\nI could not refuse.\n\nWe entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some\nstraw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on\nher knees. She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with\nher, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My\ncousin wept also.\n\n“Oh, Justine!” said she. “Why did you rob me of my last consolation?\nI relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I\nwas not so miserable as I am now.”\n\n“And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also\njoin with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?” Her\nvoice was suffocated with sobs.\n\n“Rise, my poor girl,” said Elizabeth; “why do you kneel,\nif you are innocent? I am not one of your enemies, I believed you\nguiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had\nyourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be\nassured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a\nmoment, but your own confession.”",
      "“I did confess, but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might\nobtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than\nall my other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I was\ncondemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced,\nuntil I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I\nwas. He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if\nI continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked\non me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What could I do?\nIn an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly\nmiserable.”\n\nShe paused, weeping, and then continued, “I thought with horror, my\nsweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed\naunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable\nof a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.\nDear William! dearest blessed child! I soon shall see you again in\nheaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I\nam to suffer ignominy and death.”",
      "“Oh, Justine! Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.\nWhy did you confess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not fear. I\nwill proclaim, I will prove your innocence. I will melt the stony\nhearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers. You shall not die!\nYou, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!\nNo! No! I never could survive so horrible a misfortune.”\n\nJustine shook her head mournfully. “I do not fear to die,” she said;\n“that pang is past. God raises my weakness and gives me courage to\nendure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember\nme and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the\nfate awaiting me. Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to\nthe will of heaven!”\n\nDuring this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room,\nwhere I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair!\nWho dared talk of that? The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass\nthe awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such\ndeep and bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth and ground them together,\nuttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When\nshe saw who it was, she approached me and said, “Dear sir, you are very\nkind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?”",
      "I could not answer. “No, Justine,” said Elizabeth; “he is more\nconvinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you\nhad confessed, he did not credit it.”\n\n“I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest\ngratitude towards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet is\nthe affection of others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more than\nhalf my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my\ninnocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.”\n\nThus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed\ngained the resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the\nnever-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or\nconsolation. Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was\nthe misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair\nmoon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and\ndespair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within\nme which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several hours with\nJustine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear\nherself away. “I wish,” cried she, “that I were to die with you; I\ncannot live in this world of misery.”",
      "Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty\nrepressed her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice\nof half-suppressed emotion, “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth,\nmy beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and\npreserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever\nsuffer! Live, and be happy, and make others so.”\n\nAnd on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeth’s heart-rending eloquence\nfailed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the\ncriminality of the saintly sufferer. My passionate and indignant\nappeals were lost upon them. And when I received their cold answers\nand heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed\navowal died away on my lips. Thus I might proclaim myself a madman,\nbut not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim. She\nperished on the scaffold as a murderess!",
      "From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and\nvoiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing! And my\nfather’s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was\nthe work of my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these\nare not your last tears! Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and\nthe sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!\nFrankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he\nwho would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no\nthought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear\ncountenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life\nin serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond\nhis hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction\npause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!\n\nThus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair,\nI beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and\nJustine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.\n\nChapter 9",
      "Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have\nbeen worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of\ninaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope\nand fear. Justine died, she rested, and I was alive. The blood flowed\nfreely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my\nheart which nothing could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered\nlike an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond\ndescription horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet\nbehind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.\nI had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment\nwhen I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow\nbeings. Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience\nwhich allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and\nfrom thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and\nthe sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures\nsuch as no language can describe.\n\nThis state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never\nentirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained. I shunned\nthe face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me;\nsolitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, deathlike solitude.",
      "My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition\nand habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his\nserene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and\nawaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.\n“Do you think, Victor,” said he, “that I do not suffer\nalso? No one could love a child more than I loved your\nbrother”—tears came into his eyes as he spoke—“but\nis it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting\ntheir unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty\nowed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment,\nor even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for\nsociety.”\n\nThis advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I\nshould have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if\nremorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my\nother sensations. Now I could only answer my father with a look of\ndespair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.",
      "About this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change was\nparticularly agreeable to me. The shutting of the gates regularly at\nten o’clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that\nhour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome\nto me. I was now free. Often, after the rest of the family had\nretired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the\nwater. Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and\nsometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to\npursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections. I\nwas often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only\nunquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and\nheavenly—if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and\ninterrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore—often,\nI say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters\nmight close over me and my calamities for ever. But I was restrained,\nwhen I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly\nloved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought also of my\nfather and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them\nexposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose\namong them?",
      "At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my\nmind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that\ncould not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of\nunalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had\ncreated should perpetrate some new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling\nthat all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime,\nwhich by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.\nThere was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained\nbehind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of\nhim I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to\nextinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I\nreflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds\nof moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the\nAndes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base. I wished\nto see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his\nhead and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.",
      "Our house was the house of mourning. My father’s health was deeply\nshaken by the horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and\ndesponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all\npleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she\nthen thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted\nand destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth\nwandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our\nfuture prospects. The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from\nthe earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest\nsmiles.",
      "“When I reflect, my dear cousin,” said she, “on the miserable death of\nJustine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before\nappeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and\ninjustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient\ndays or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to\nreason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men\nappear to me as monsters thirsting for each other’s blood. Yet I am\ncertainly unjust. Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and\nif she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly\nshe would have been the most depraved of human creatures. For the sake\nof a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend,\na child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if\nit had been her own! I could not consent to the death of any human\nbeing, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to\nremain in the society of men. But she was innocent. I know, I feel\nshe was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me.\nAlas! Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can\nassure themselves of certain happiness? I feel as if I were walking on\nthe edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and\nendeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine were\nassassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free,\nand perhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer on the\nscaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a\nwretch.”",
      "I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed,\nbut in effect, was the true murderer. Elizabeth read my anguish in my\ncountenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, “My dearest friend, you\nmust calm yourself. These events have affected me, God knows how\ndeeply; but I am not so wretched as you are. There is an expression of\ndespair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me\ntremble. Dear Victor, banish these dark passions. Remember the\nfriends around you, who centre all their hopes in you. Have we lost\nthe power of rendering you happy? Ah! While we love, while we are\ntrue to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native\ncountry, we may reap every tranquil blessing—what can disturb our\npeace?”\n\nAnd could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every\nother gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my\nheart? Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at\nthat very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.",
      "Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of\nheaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were\nineffectual. I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial\ninfluence could penetrate. The wounded deer dragging its fainting\nlimbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had\npierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.\n\nSometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but\nsometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily\nexercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable\nsensations. It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left\nmy home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought\nin the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and\nmy ephemeral, because human, sorrows. My wanderings were directed\ntowards the valley of Chamounix. I had visited it frequently during my\nboyhood. Six years had passed since then: _I_ was a wreck, but nought\nhad changed in those savage and enduring scenes.",
      "I performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I afterwards\nhired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive\ninjury on these rugged roads. The weather was fine; it was about the\nmiddle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of\nJustine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe. The\nweight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in\nthe ravine of Arve. The immense mountains and precipices that overhung\nme on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and\nthe dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as\nOmnipotence—and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less\nalmighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here\ndisplayed in their most terrific guise. Still, as I ascended higher,\nthe valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.\nRuined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the\nimpetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from\namong the trees formed a scene of singular beauty. But it was\naugmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and\nshining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another\nearth, the habitations of another race of beings.",
      "I passed the bridge of Pélissier, where the ravine, which the river\nforms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that\noverhangs it. Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix. This\nvalley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and\npicturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed. The\nhigh and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no\nmore ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers approached\nthe road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and\nmarked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and\nmagnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_,\nand its tremendous _dôme_ overlooked the valley.\n\nA tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this\njourney. Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and\nrecognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the\nlighthearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothing\naccents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more. Then again the\nkindly influence ceased to act—I found myself fettered again to grief\nand indulging in all the misery of reflection. Then I spurred on my\nanimal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all,\nmyself—or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on\nthe grass, weighed down by horror and despair.",
      "At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeeded\nto the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured.\nFor a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid\nlightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of\nthe Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath. The same lulling sounds\nacted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head\nupon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed\nthe giver of oblivion.\n\nChapter 10",
      "I spent the following day roaming through the valley. I stood beside\nthe sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that\nwith slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to\nbarricade the valley. The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before\nme; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were\nscattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious\npresence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling\nwaves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the\navalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the\naccumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,\nwas ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in\ntheir hands. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the\ngreatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me\nfrom all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my\ngrief, they subdued and tranquillised it. In some degree, also, they\ndiverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the\nlast month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,\nwaited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I\nhad contemplated during the day. They congregated round me; the\nunstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,\nand ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds—they all\ngathered round me and bade me be at peace.",
      "Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All of\nsoul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every\nthought. The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the\nsummits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those\nmighty friends. Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them\nin their cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My mule was\nbrought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of\nMontanvert. I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous\nand ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.\nIt had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the\nsoul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.\nThe sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the\neffect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing\ncares of life. I determined to go without a guide, for I was well\nacquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the\nsolitary grandeur of the scene.",
      "The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short\nwindings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the\nmountain. It is a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand spots\nthe traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie\nbroken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent,\nleaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon\nother trees. The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines\nof snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is\nparticularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking\nin a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw\ndestruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall or\nluxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.\nI looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers\nwhich ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite\nmountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain\npoured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I\nreceived from the objects around me. Alas! Why does man boast of\nsensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders\nthem more necessary beings. If our impulses were confined to hunger,\nthirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by\nevery wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may\nconvey to us.",
      "We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.\n     We rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day.\n  We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,\n     Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;\n  It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,\n     The path of its departure still is free.\n  Man’s yesterday may ne’er be like his morrow;\n     Nought may endure but mutability!",
      "It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some\ntime I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered\nboth that and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated\nthe cloud, and I descended upon the glacier. The surface is very\nuneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and\ninterspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice is almost a\nleague in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The\nopposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where I\nnow stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;\nand above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess\nof the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The sea,\nor rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains,\nwhose aerial summits hung over its recesses. Their icy and glittering\npeaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. My heart, which was\nbefore sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed,\n“Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow\nbeds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion,\naway from the joys of life.”",
      "As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,\nadvancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the\ncrevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his\nstature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was\ntroubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me,\nbut I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. I\nperceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!)\nthat it was the wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage and\nhorror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in\nmortal combat. He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish,\ncombined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness\nrendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely\nobserved this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance,\nand I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious\ndetestation and contempt.\n\n“Devil,” I exclaimed, “do you dare approach me? And do\nnot you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?\nBegone, vile insect! Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust! And,\noh! That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore\nthose victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!”",
      "“I expected this reception,” said the dæmon. “All men hate the\nwretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all\nliving things! Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature,\nto whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of\none of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life?\nDo your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of\nmankind. If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and\nyou at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it\nbe satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.”\n\n“Abhorred monster! Fiend that thou art! The tortures of hell are too\nmild a vengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! You reproach me with\nyour creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I\nso negligently bestowed.”\n\nMy rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the\nfeelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.\n\nHe easily eluded me and said,",
      "“Be calm! I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred\non my devoted head. Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to\nincrease my misery? Life, although it may only be an accumulation of\nanguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it. Remember, thou hast made\nme more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my\njoints more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself in\nopposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and\ndocile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part,\nthe which thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every\nother and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy\nclemency and affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature;\nI ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou\ndrivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I\nalone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made\nme a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.”\n\n“Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between you\nand me; we are enemies. Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight,\nin which one must fall.”",
      "“How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a\nfavourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and\ncompassion? Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed\nwith love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my\ncreator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures,\nwho owe me nothing? They spurn and hate me. The desert mountains and\ndreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many days; the\ncaves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the\nonly one which man does not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they\nare kinder to me than your fellow beings. If the multitude of mankind\nknew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for\nmy destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me? I will keep\nno terms with my enemies. I am miserable, and they shall share my\nwretchedness. Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver\nthem from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that\nnot only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be\nswallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. Let your compassion be\nmoved, and do not disdain me. Listen to my tale; when you have heard\nthat, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve.\nBut hear me. The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they\nare, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned. Listen\nto me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with\na satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the\neternal justice of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me,\nand then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.”",
      "“Why do you call to my remembrance,” I rejoined, “circumstances of\nwhich I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and\nauthor? Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw\nlight! Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you!\nYou have made me wretched beyond expression. You have left me no power\nto consider whether I am just to you or not. Begone! Relieve me from\nthe sight of your detested form.”\n\n“Thus I relieve thee, my creator,” he said, and placed his hated hands\nbefore my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; “thus I take from\nthee a sight which you abhor. Still thou canst listen to me and grant\nme thy compassion. By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this\nfrom you. Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of\nthis place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon\nthe mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends\nto hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another\nworld, you will have heard my story and can decide. On you it rests,\nwhether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless\nlife, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of\nyour own speedy ruin.”",
      "As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed. My heart\nwas full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the\nvarious arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to\nhis tale. I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my\nresolution. I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my\nbrother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.\nFor the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards\nhis creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I\ncomplained of his wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with\nhis demand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite\nrock. The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we\nentered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy\nheart and depressed spirits. But I consented to listen, and seating\nmyself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began\nhis tale.\n\nChapter 11",
      "“It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of\nmy being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.\nA strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard,\nand smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I\nlearned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. By\ndegrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I\nwas obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me and troubled\nme, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now\nsuppose, the light poured in upon me again. I walked and, I believe,\ndescended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.\nBefore, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my\ntouch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with\nno obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The light\nbecame more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I\nwalked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was the\nforest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting\nfrom my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This\nroused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I\nfound hanging on the trees or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirst\nat the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.",
      "“It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it\nwere, instinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted\nyour apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some\nclothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of\nnight. I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could\ndistinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat\ndown and wept.\n\n“Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of\npleasure. I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the\ntrees. [The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly,\nbut it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries.\nI was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with\nwhich I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. No distinct\nideas occupied my mind; all was confused. I felt light, and hunger,\nand thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on\nall sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could\ndistinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with\npleasure.",
      "“Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had\ngreatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each\nother. I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with\ndrink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted\nwhen I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my\nears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had\noften intercepted the light from my eyes. I began also to observe,\nwith greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the\nboundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. Sometimes I\ntried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.\nSometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the\nuncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into\nsilence again.\n\n“The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened\nform, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest. My\nsensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every\nday additional ideas. My eyes became accustomed to the light and to\nperceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from\nthe herb, and by degrees, one herb from another. I found that the\nsparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and\nthrush were sweet and enticing.",
      "“One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been\nleft by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the\nwarmth I experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live\nembers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange,\nI thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects! I\nexamined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be\ncomposed of wood. I quickly collected some branches, but they were wet\nand would not burn. I was pained at this and sat still watching the\noperation of the fire. The wet wood which I had placed near the heat\ndried and itself became inflamed. I reflected on this, and by touching\nthe various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in\ncollecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a\nplentiful supply of fire. When night came on and brought sleep with\nit, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I\ncovered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches\nupon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank\ninto sleep.",
      "“It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.\nI uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. I\nobserved this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the\nembers when they were nearly extinguished. When night came again I\nfound, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that\nthe discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found\nsome of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and\ntasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees. I\ntried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on\nthe live embers. I found that the berries were spoiled by this\noperation, and the nuts and roots much improved.",
      "“Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day\nsearching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When\nI found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto\ninhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be\nmore easily satisfied. In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the\nloss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how\nto reproduce it. I gave several hours to the serious consideration of\nthis difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply\nit, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood\ntowards the setting sun. I passed three days in these rambles and at\nlength discovered the open country. A great fall of snow had taken\nplace the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the\nappearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold\ndamp substance that covered the ground.",
      "“It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and\nshelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which\nhad doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. This\nwas a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great\ncuriosity. Finding the door open, I entered. An old man sat in it,\nnear a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast. He turned on\nhearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the\nhut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form\nhardly appeared capable. His appearance, different from any I had ever\nbefore seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted\nby the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not\npenetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite\nand divine a retreat as Pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell\nafter their sufferings in the lake of fire. I greedily devoured the\nremnants of the shepherd’s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese,\nmilk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like. Then, overcome by\nfatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.",
      "“It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which\nshone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my\ntravels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in a\nwallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until\nat sunset I arrived at a village. How miraculous did this appear! The\nhuts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by\nturns. The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw\nplaced at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One\nof the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within\nthe door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.\nThe whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,\ngrievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I\nescaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,\nquite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had\nbeheld in the village. This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat\nand pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I\ndared not enter it. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so\nlow that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood, however,\nwas placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and\nalthough the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an\nagreeable asylum from the snow and rain.",
      "“Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter,\nhowever miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more\nfrom the barbarity of man. As soon as morning dawned I crept from my\nkennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could\nremain in the habitation I had found. It was situated against the back\nof the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig\nsty and a clear pool of water. One part was open, and by that I had\ncrept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived\nwith stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on\noccasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and\nthat was sufficient for me.\n\n“Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I\nretired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered\ntoo well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power. I\nhad first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf\nof coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink\nmore conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by\nmy retreat. The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept\nperfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was\ntolerably warm.",
      "“Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until\nsomething should occur which might alter my determination. It was\nindeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence,\nthe rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with\npleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little\nwater when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld\na young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. The\ngirl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found\ncottagers and farmhouse servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a\ncoarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair\nhair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. I lost\nsight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing\nthe pail, which was now partly filled with milk. As she walked along,\nseemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose\ncountenance expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few sounds with\nan air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the\ncottage himself. She followed, and they disappeared. Presently I saw\nthe young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field\nbehind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the\nhouse and sometimes in the yard.",
      "“On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the\ncottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been\nfilled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost\nimperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.\nThrough this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean\nbut very bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small fire, sat an\nold man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. The\nyoung girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she\ntook something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat\ndown beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play\nand to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the\nnightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had\nnever beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent\ncountenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle\nmanners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air\nwhich I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of\nwhich the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then\npronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt\nat his feet. He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection\nthat I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were\na mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced,\neither from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the\nwindow, unable to bear these emotions.",
      "“Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a\nload of wood. The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of\nhis burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on\nthe fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage,\nand he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed\npleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she\nplaced in water, and then upon the fire. She afterwards continued her\nwork, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily\nemployed in digging and pulling up roots. After he had been employed\nthus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the\ncottage together.",
      "“The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance\nof his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to\neat. The meal was quickly dispatched. The young woman was again\noccupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the\ncottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.\nNothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent\ncreatures. One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming\nwith benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his\nfigure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his\neyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. The\nold man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different\nfrom those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the\nfields.",
      "“Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the\ncottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was\ndelighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the\npleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours. In the evening\nthe young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations\nwhich I did not understand; and the old man again took up the\ninstrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in\nthe morning. So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play,\nbut to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the\nharmony of the old man’s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since\nfound that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the\nscience of words or letters.\n\n“The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time,\nextinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.”\n\nChapter 12",
      "“I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the\noccurrences of the day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners\nof these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not. I\nremembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from\nthe barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I\nmight hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would\nremain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the\nmotives which influenced their actions.\n\n“The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. The young woman\narranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed\nafter the first meal.\n\n“This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.\nThe young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in\nvarious laborious occupations within. The old man, whom I soon\nperceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or\nin contemplation. Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the\nyounger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion. They\nperformed towards him every little office of affection and duty with\ngentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.",
      "“They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often\nwent apart and appeared to weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness,\nbut I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely creatures were\nmiserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being,\nshould be wretched. Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? They\npossessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every\nluxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands\nwhen hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more,\nthey enjoyed one another’s company and speech, interchanging each day\nlooks of affection and kindness. What did their tears imply? Did they\nreally express pain? I was at first unable to solve these questions,\nbut perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which\nwere at first enigmatic.",
      "“A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of\nthe uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they\nsuffered that evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourishment\nconsisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of\none cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters\ncould scarcely procure food to support it. They often, I believe,\nsuffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two\nyounger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old\nman when they reserved none for themselves.\n\n“This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed,\nduring the night, to steal a part of their store for my own\nconsumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on\nthe cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and\nroots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.\n\n“I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist\ntheir labours. I found that the youth spent a great part of each day\nin collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often\ntook his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home\nfiring sufficient for the consumption of several days.",
      "“I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she\nopened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great\npile of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the\nyouth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure,\nthat he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the\ncottage and cultivating the garden.",
      "“By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that\nthese people possessed a method of communicating their experience and\nfeelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words\nthey spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the\nminds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike science,\nand I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in\nevery attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick, and\nthe words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible\nobjects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the\nmystery of their reference. By great application, however, and after having\nremained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I\ndiscovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of\ndiscourse; I learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and\n_wood._ I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth\nand his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only\none, which was _father._ The girl was called _sister_ or\n_Agatha,_ and the youth _Felix, brother,_ or _son_. I cannot\ndescribe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of\nthese sounds and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other\nwords without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as _good,\ndearest, unhappy._",
      "“I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of\nthe cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I\nfelt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys. I saw\nfew human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the\ncottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the\nsuperior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I could perceive,\noften endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that\nhe called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a\ncheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure\neven upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled\nwith tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I\ngenerally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after\nhaving listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus\nwith Felix. He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my\nunpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his\nfriends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more\ncheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old\nman.",
      "“I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked\nthe dispositions of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty\nand want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little\nwhite flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in\nthe morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that\nobstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and\nbrought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual\nastonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible\nhand. In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring\nfarmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner,\nyet brought no wood with him. At other times he worked in the garden,\nbut as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old\nman and Agatha.",
      "“This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I\ndiscovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when\nhe talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs\nfor speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend\nthese also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand\nthe sounds for which they stood as signs? I improved, however,\nsensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of\nconversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I\neasily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to\nthe cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become\nmaster of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them\noverlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast\nperpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.\n\n“I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty,\nand delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself\nin a transparent pool! At first I started back, unable to believe that\nit was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became\nfully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was\nfilled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.\nAlas! I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable\ndeformity.",
      "“As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow\nvanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth. From this\ntime Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of\nimpending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found, was\ncoarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.\nSeveral new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they\ndressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season\nadvanced.\n\n“The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did\nnot rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its\nwaters. This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the\nearth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.",
      "“My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I\nattended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in\nvarious occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in\nobserving my friends. When they had retired to rest, if there was any\nmoon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected\nmy own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it\nwas necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those\noffices that I had seen done by Felix. I afterwards found that these\nlabours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and\nonce or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words _good\nspirit, wonderful_; but I did not then understand the signification\nof these terms.",
      "“My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the\nmotives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to\nknow why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad. I thought\n(foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to\nthese deserving people. When I slept or was absent, the forms of the\nvenerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix\nflitted before me. I looked upon them as superior beings who would be\nthe arbiters of my future destiny. I formed in my imagination a\nthousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of\nme. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle\ndemeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and\nafterwards their love.\n\n“These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to\nthe acquiring the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but\nsupple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their\ntones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.\nIt was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose\nintentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved\nbetter treatment than blows and execration.",
      "“The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the\naspect of the earth. Men who before this change seemed to have been\nhid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of\ncultivation. The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves\nbegan to bud forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth! Fit habitation\nfor gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and\nunwholesome. My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of\nnature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil,\nand the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.”\n\nChapter 13\n\n“I now hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall relate\nevents that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been,\nhave made me what I am.\n\n“Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies\ncloudless. It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy\nshould now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. My\nsenses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and\na thousand sights of beauty.",
      "“It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested\nfrom labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the children\nlistened to him—that I observed the countenance of Felix was\nmelancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father\npaused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired\nthe cause of his son’s sorrow. Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and\nthe old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.\n\n“It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide.\nThe lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black\nveil. Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by\npronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her voice was\nmusical but unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this word,\nFelix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her\nveil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. Her\nhair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were\ndark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular\nproportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with\na lovely pink.",
      "“Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of\nsorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of\necstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his\neyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I\nthought him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by\ndifferent feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held\nout her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as\nwell as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear to\nunderstand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and\ndismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some\nconversation took place between him and his father, and the young\nstranger knelt at the old man’s feet and would have kissed his hand,\nbut he raised her and embraced her affectionately.",
      "“I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds\nand appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood\nby nor herself understood the cottagers. They made many signs which I\ndid not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness\nthrough the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the\nmorning mists. Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of\ndelight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed\nthe hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made\nsigns which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she\ncame. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances,\nexpressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I\nfound, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger\nrepeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language;\nand the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the\nsame instructions to the same end. The stranger learned about twenty\nwords at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had\nbefore understood, but I profited by the others.",
      "“As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. When they\nseparated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, ‘Good night\nsweet Safie.’ He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and\nby the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely\nguest was the subject of their conversation. I ardently desired to\nunderstand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found\nit utterly impossible.\n\n“The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual\noccupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the\nold man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly\nbeautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my\neyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or\ndying away like a nightingale of the woods.\n\n“When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first\ndeclined it. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in\nsweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old\nman appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to\nexplain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she\nbestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.",
      "“The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration\nthat joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.\nSafie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the\nknowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most\nof the words uttered by my protectors.\n\n“In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and\nthe green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the\nscent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods;\nthe sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal\nrambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably\nshortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never\nventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same\ntreatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered.\n\n“My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily\nmaster the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than\nthe Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken\naccents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that\nwas spoken.\n\n“While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as\nit was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field\nfor wonder and delight.",
      "“The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney’s _Ruins\nof Empires_. I should not have understood the purport of this book had not\nFelix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this\nwork, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the\nEastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history\nand a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave\nme an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different\nnations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous\ngenius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue\nof the early Romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of the\ndecline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard\nof the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the\nhapless fate of its original inhabitants.",
      "“These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was\nman, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so\nvicious and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil\nprinciple and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and\ngodlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour\nthat can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on\nrecord have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more\nabject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. For a long time I\ncould not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or\neven why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of\nvice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and\nloathing.\n\n“Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.\nWhile I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the\nArabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. I\nheard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid\npoverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.",
      "“The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the\npossessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and\nunsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with\nonly one of these advantages, but without either he was considered,\nexcept in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to\nwaste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! And what was I? Of\nmy creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I\npossessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides,\nendued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even\nof the same nature as man. I was more agile than they and could\nsubsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with\nless injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked\naround I saw and heard of none like me. Was I, then, a monster, a blot\nupon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?\n\n“I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted\nupon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with\nknowledge. Oh, that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor\nknown nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!",
      "“Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind when it\nhas once seized on it like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to\nshake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one\nmeans to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death—a state\nwhich I feared yet did not understand. I admired virtue and good\nfeelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my\ncottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except\nthrough means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and\nunknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of\nbecoming one among my fellows. The gentle words of Agatha and the\nanimated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me. The mild\nexhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved\nFelix were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch!\n\n“Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard of the\ndifference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the\nfather doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the\nolder child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up\nin the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained\nknowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which\nbind one human being to another in mutual bonds.",
      "“But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my\ninfant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if\nthey had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I\ndistinguished nothing. From my earliest remembrance I had been as I\nthen was in height and proportion. I had never yet seen a being\nresembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me. What was I? The\nquestion again recurred, to be answered only with groans.\n\n“I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to\nreturn to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various\nfeelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated\nin additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in\nan innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them).”\n\nChapter 14\n\n“Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends. It was\none which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding\nas it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to\none so utterly inexperienced as I was.",
      "“The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a good\nfamily in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence,\nrespected by his superiors and beloved by his equals. His son was bred\nin the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the\nhighest distinction. A few months before my arrival they had lived in\na large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and\npossessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or\ntaste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.\n\n“The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. He was a\nTurkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some\nreason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government.\nHe was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from\nConstantinople to join him. He was tried and condemned to death. The\ninjustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant;\nand it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime\nalleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation.",
      "“Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and\nindignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the\ncourt. He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then\nlooked around for the means. After many fruitless attempts to gain\nadmittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an\nunguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the\nunfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the\nexecution of the barbarous sentence. Felix visited the grate at night\nand made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour. The Turk,\namazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer\nby promises of reward and wealth. Felix rejected his offers with\ncontempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit\nher father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the\nyouth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed\na treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.",
      "“The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made\non the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in\nhis interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he\nshould be conveyed to a place of safety. Felix was too delicate to\naccept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the\nevent as to the consummation of his happiness.\n\n“During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for\nthe escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several\nletters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to\nexpress her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old\nman, a servant of her father who understood French. She thanked him in\nthe most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and\nat the same time she gently deplored her own fate.\n\n“I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence\nin the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters\nwere often in the hands of Felix or Agatha. Before I depart I will\ngive them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present,\nas the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat\nthe substance of them to you.",
      "“Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a\nslave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of\nthe father of Safie, who married her. The young girl spoke in high and\nenthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the\nbondage to which she was now reduced. She instructed her daughter in\nthe tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of\nintellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female\nfollowers of Muhammad. This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly\nimpressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again\nreturning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem,\nallowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to\nthe temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble\nemulation for virtue. The prospect of marrying a Christian and\nremaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in\nsociety was enchanting to her.",
      "“The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the night\nprevious to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant\nmany leagues from Paris. Felix had procured passports in the name of\nhis father, sister, and himself. He had previously communicated his\nplan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under\nthe pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in\nan obscure part of Paris.\n\n“Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont\nCenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable\nopportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.\n\n“Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his\ndeparture, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she\nshould be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in\nexpectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society\nof the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest\naffection. They conversed with one another through the means of an\ninterpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie\nsang to him the divine airs of her native country.",
      "“The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes\nof the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other\nplans. He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a\nChristian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear\nlukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer\nif he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they\ninhabited. He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled\nto prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and\nsecretly to take his daughter with him when he departed. His plans\nwere facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.",
      "“The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their\nvictim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer. The\nplot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were\nthrown into prison. The news reached Felix and roused him from his\ndream of pleasure. His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay\nin a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of\nher whom he loved. This idea was torture to him. He quickly arranged\nwith the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity\nfor escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a\nboarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian,\nhe hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the\nlaw, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.\n\n“He did not succeed. They remained confined for five months before the\ntrial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune\nand condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.",
      "“They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I\ndiscovered them. Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for\nwhom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on\ndiscovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin,\nbecame a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with\nhis daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him,\nas he said, in some plan of future maintenance.\n\n“Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered\nhim, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family. He could\nhave endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his\nvirtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss\nof his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. The\narrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.\n\n“When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth\nand rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her\nlover, but to prepare to return to her native country. The generous\nnature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to\nexpostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his\ntyrannical mandate.",
      "“A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter’s apartment and told\nher hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn\nhad been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the\nFrench government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to\nConstantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours. He\nintended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential\nservant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his\nproperty, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.\n\n“When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it\nwould become her to pursue in this emergency. A residence in Turkey\nwas abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse\nto it. By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she\nheard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where\nhe then resided. She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her\ndetermination. Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a\nsum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn,\nbut who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for\nGermany.",
      "“She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage\nof De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill. Safie nursed her\nwith the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the\nArabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country\nand utterly ignorant of the customs of the world. She fell, however,\ninto good hands. The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for\nwhich they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in\nwhich they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at\nthe cottage of her lover.”\n\nChapter 15\n\n“Such was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me deeply.\nI learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire\ntheir virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.\n\n“As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and\ngenerosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to\nbecome an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities\nwere called forth and displayed. But in giving an account of the\nprogress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred\nin the beginning of the month of August of the same year.",
      "“One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I\ncollected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on\nthe ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and\nsome books. I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel. \nFortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I\nhad acquired at the cottage; they consisted of _Paradise Lost_, a volume\nof _Plutarch’s Lives_, and the _Sorrows of Werter_. The\npossession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually\nstudied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were\nemployed in their ordinary occupations.",
      "“I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced\nin me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me\nto ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In\nthe _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affecting\nstory, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon\nwhat had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a\nnever-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle and\ndomestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and\nfeelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded\nwell with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which\nwere for ever alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a\nmore divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character\ncontained no pretension, but it sank deep. The disquisitions upon\ndeath and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not\npretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards\nthe opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely\nunderstanding it.",
      "“As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and\ncondition. I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely\nunlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I\nwas a listener. I sympathised with and partly understood them, but I\nwas unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none.\n‘The path of my departure was free,’ and there was none to lament my\nannihilation. My person was hideous and my stature gigantic. What did\nthis mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my\ndestination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to\nsolve them.",
      "“The volume of _Plutarch’s Lives_ which I possessed contained the\nhistories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This book\nhad a far different effect upon me from the _Sorrows of Werter_. I\nlearned from Werter’s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch\ntaught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my\nown reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages. Many\nthings I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had a very\nconfused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,\nand boundless seas. But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and\nlarge assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the\nonly school in which I had studied human nature, but this book\ndeveloped new and mightier scenes of action. I read of men concerned\nin public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the\ngreatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as\nfar as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they\nwere, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these\nfeelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa,\nSolon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The\npatriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a\nfirm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had\nbeen made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should\nhave been imbued with different sensations.",
      "“But _Paradise Lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions. I read\nit, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as\na true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the\npicture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of\nexciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity\nstruck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to\nany other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine\nin every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a\nperfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of\nhis Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from\nbeings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.\nMany times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for\noften, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter\ngall of envy rose within me.",
      "“Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon\nafter my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of\nthe dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had\nneglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in\nwhich they were written, I began to study them with diligence. It was\nyour journal of the four months that preceded my creation. You\nminutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress\nof your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic\noccurrences. You doubtless recollect these papers. Here they are.\nEverything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed\norigin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances\nwhich produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious\nand loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own\nhorrors and rendered mine indelible. I sickened as I read. ‘Hateful\nday when I received life!’ I exclaimed in agony. ‘Accursed creator!\nWhy did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me in\ndisgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own\nimage; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the\nvery resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire\nand encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.’",
      "“These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude;\nbut when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and\nbenevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should\nbecome acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would\ncompassionate me and overlook my personal deformity. Could they turn\nfrom their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion\nand friendship? I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way\nto fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate. I\npostponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance\nattached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.\nBesides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every\nday’s experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking\nuntil a few more months should have added to my sagacity.",
      "“Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage. The\npresence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also\nfound that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha\nspent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in\ntheir labours by servants. They did not appear rich, but they were\ncontented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while\nmine became every day more tumultuous. Increase of knowledge only\ndiscovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. I\ncherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person\nreflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail\nimage and that inconstant shade.\n\n“I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial\nwhich in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my\nthoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and\ndared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my\nfeelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed\nsmiles of consolation. But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my\nsorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone. I remembered Adam’s\nsupplication to his Creator. But where was mine? He had abandoned me,\nand in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him.",
      "“Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay\nand fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it\nhad worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did\nnot heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my\nconformation for the endurance of cold than heat. But my chief\ndelights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay\napparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention\ntowards the cottagers. Their happiness was not decreased by the\nabsence of summer. They loved and sympathised with one another; and\ntheir joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the\ncasualties that took place around them. The more I saw of them, the\ngreater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my\nheart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see\ntheir sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost\nlimit of my ambition. I dared not think that they would turn them from\nme with disdain and horror. The poor that stopped at their door were\nnever driven away. I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a\nlittle food or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not\nbelieve myself utterly unworthy of it.",
      "“The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken\nplace since I awoke into life. My attention at this time was solely\ndirected towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my\nprotectors. I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally\nfixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.\nI had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my\nperson was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly\nbeheld me. My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I\nthought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain\nthe good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means\nbe tolerated by my younger protectors.\n\n“One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground\nand diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha,\nand Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own\ndesire, was left alone in the cottage. When his children had departed,\nhe took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more\nsweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before. At first his\ncountenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued,\nthoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the\ninstrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.",
      "“My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which\nwould decide my hopes or realise my fears. The servants were gone to a\nneighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an\nexcellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my\nlimbs failed me and I sank to the ground. Again I rose, and exerting\nall the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had\nplaced before my hovel to conceal my retreat. The fresh air revived\nme, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their\ncottage.\n\n“I knocked. ‘Who is there?’ said the old man. ‘Come in.’\n\n“I entered. ‘Pardon this intrusion,’ said I; ‘I am\na traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you\nwould allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.’\n\n“‘Enter,’ said De Lacey, ‘and I will try in what\nmanner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are\nfrom home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to\nprocure food for you.’\n\n“‘Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is\nwarmth and rest only that I need.’\n\n“I sat down, and a silence ensued. I knew that every minute was\nprecious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence\nthe interview, when the old man addressed me.\n\n‘By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you\nFrench?’",
      "“‘No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that\nlanguage only. I am now going to claim the protection of some friends,\nwhom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.’\n\n“‘Are they Germans?’\n\n“‘No, they are French. But let us change the subject. I am an\nunfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no relation\nor friend upon earth. These amiable people to whom I go have never\nseen me and know little of me. I am full of fears, for if I fail\nthere, I am an outcast in the world for ever.’\n\n“‘Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but\nthe hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are\nfull of brotherly love and charity. Rely, therefore, on your hopes;\nand if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.’\n\n“‘They are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in the world;\nbut, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. I have good\ndispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree\nbeneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they\nought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable\nmonster.’\n\n“‘That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot\nyou undeceive them?’",
      "“‘I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I\nfeel so many overwhelming terrors. I tenderly love these friends; I\nhave, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily\nkindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and\nit is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.’\n\n“‘Where do these friends reside?’\n\n“‘Near this spot.’\n\n“The old man paused and then continued, ‘If you will unreservedly\nconfide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in\nundeceiving them. I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but\nthere is something in your words which persuades me that you are\nsincere. I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure\nto be in any way serviceable to a human creature.’\n\n“‘Excellent man! I thank you and accept your generous offer. You\nraise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid,\nI shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow\ncreatures.’\n\n“‘Heaven forbid! Even if you were really criminal, for that can only\ndrive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. I also am\nunfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent;\njudge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.’",
      "“‘How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? From your lips\nfirst have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall\nbe for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success\nwith those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.’\n\n“‘May I know the names and residence of those friends?’\n\n“I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to\nrob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever. I struggled vainly for\nfirmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my\nremaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud. At that\nmoment I heard the steps of my younger protectors. I had not a moment\nto lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, ‘Now is the\ntime! Save and protect me! You and your family are the friends whom I\nseek. Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!’\n\n“‘Great God!’ exclaimed the old man. ‘Who are you?’",
      "“At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and\nAgatha entered. Who can describe their horror and consternation on\nbeholding me? Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her\nfriend, rushed out of the cottage. Felix darted forward, and with\nsupernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in\na transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently\nwith a stick. I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends\nthe antelope. But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and\nI refrained. I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when,\novercome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general\ntumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.”\n\nChapter 16\n\n“Cursed, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did I\nnot extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly\nbestowed? I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my\nfeelings were those of rage and revenge. I could with pleasure have\ndestroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with\ntheir shrieks and misery.",
      "“When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and\nnow, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my\nanguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild beast that had broken\nthe toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging\nthrough the wood with a stag-like swiftness. Oh! What a miserable\nnight I passed! The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees\nwaved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird\nburst forth amidst the universal stillness. All, save I, were at rest\nor in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and\nfinding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread\nhavoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed\nthe ruin.\n\n“But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became\nfatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in\nthe sick impotence of despair. There was none among the myriads of men\nthat existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness\ntowards my enemies? No; from that moment I declared everlasting war\nagainst the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me\nand sent me forth to this insupportable misery.",
      "“The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was\nimpossible to return to my retreat during that day. Accordingly I hid\nmyself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours\nto reflection on my situation.\n\n“The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some\ndegree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the\ncottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my\nconclusions. I had certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that\nmy conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a\nfool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children. I\nought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to\nhave discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have\nbeen prepared for my approach. But I did not believe my errors to be\nirretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the\ncottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my\nparty.",
      "“These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound\nsleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by\npeaceful dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever\nacting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix\ntearing me from his father’s feet. I awoke exhausted, and finding that\nit was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in\nsearch of food.\n\n“When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the\nwell-known path that conducted to the cottage. All there was at peace.\nI crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the\naccustomed hour when the family arose. That hour passed, the sun\nmounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear. I\ntrembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The inside\nof the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the\nagony of this suspense.",
      "“Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they\nentered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not\nunderstand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country,\nwhich differed from that of my protectors. Soon after, however, Felix\napproached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not\nquitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from\nhis discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.\n\n“‘Do you consider,’ said his companion to him,\n‘that you will be obliged to pay three months’ rent and to lose\nthe produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and\nI beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your\ndetermination.’\n\n“‘It is utterly useless,’ replied Felix; ‘we can\nnever again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest\ndanger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and\nmy sister will never recover from their horror. I entreat you not to reason\nwith me any more. Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this\nplace.’\n\n“Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion\nentered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then\ndeparted. I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.",
      "“I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of\nutter and stupid despair. My protectors had departed and had broken\nthe only link that held me to the world. For the first time the\nfeelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to\ncontrol them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I\nbent my mind towards injury and death. When I thought of my friends,\nof the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the\nexquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of\ntears somewhat soothed me. But again when I reflected that they had\nspurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to\ninjure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. As\nnight advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage,\nand after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden,\nI waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my\noperations.",
      "“As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly\ndispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore\nalong like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my\nspirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the\ndry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage,\nmy eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon\nnearly touched. A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my\nbrand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath,\nand bushes, which I had collected. The wind fanned the fire, and the\ncottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and\nlicked it with their forked and destroying tongues.\n\n“As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of\nthe habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.",
      "“And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps? I\nresolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated\nand despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the\nthought of you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you\nwere my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness\nthan to him who had given me life? Among the lessons that Felix had\nbestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from\nthese the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.\nYou had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards\nthis place I resolved to proceed.\n\n“But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a\nsouthwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my\nonly guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass\nthrough, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I\ndid not despair. From you only could I hope for succour, although\ntowards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling,\nheartless creator! You had endowed me with perceptions and passions\nand then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.\nBut on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I\ndetermined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from\nany other being that wore the human form.",
      "“My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense. It was\nlate in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided.\nI travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a\nhuman being. Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless;\nrain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface\nof the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh,\nearth! How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being! The\nmildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall\nand bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more\ndeeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow\nfell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents\nnow and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I\noften wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me\nno respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could\nnot extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived\non the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth\nand the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial\nmanner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.",
      "“I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was\nsecured by night from the view of man. One morning, however, finding\nthat my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey\nafter the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring,\ncheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of\nthe air. I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long\nappeared dead, revive within me. Half surprised by the novelty of\nthese sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and\nforgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft tears\nagain bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with\nthankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.",
      "“I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its\nboundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many\nof the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.\nHere I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard\nthe sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade\nof a cypress. I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running\ntowards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from\nsomeone in sport. She continued her course along the precipitous sides\nof the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the\nrapid stream. I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour,\nfrom the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. She\nwas senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore\nanimation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic,\nwho was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On\nseeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms,\nhastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I\nhardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun,\nwhich he carried, at my body and fired. I sank to the ground, and my\ninjurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.",
      "“This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being\nfrom destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable\npain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of\nkindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments\nbefore gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by\npain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. But the\nagony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.\n\n“For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to\ncure the wound which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder,\nand I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any\nrate I had no means of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented\nalso by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their\ninfliction. My daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge,\nsuch as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had\nendured.\n\n“After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. The\nlabours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or\ngentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my\ndesolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for\nthe enjoyment of pleasure.\n\n“But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I\nreached the environs of Geneva.",
      "“It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among\nthe fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply\nto you. I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to\nenjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting\nbehind the stupendous mountains of Jura.\n\n“At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection,\nwhich was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came\nrunning into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of\ninfancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this\nlittle creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have\nimbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him and\neducate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in\nthis peopled earth.\n\n“Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him\ntowards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before\nhis eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his\nface and said, ‘Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to\nhurt you; listen to me.’\n\n“He struggled violently. ‘Let me go,’ he cried;\n‘monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. You\nare an ogre. Let me go, or I will tell my papa.’\n\n“‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’",
      "“‘Hideous monster! Let me go. My papa is a syndic—he is M.\nFrankenstein—he will punish you. You dare not keep me.’\n\n“‘Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom I have\nsworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.’\n\n“The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried\ndespair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a\nmoment he lay dead at my feet.\n\n“I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish\ntriumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, ‘I too can create desolation;\nmy enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and\na thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.’\n\n“As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his\nbreast. I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite\nof my malignity, it softened and attracted me. For a few moments I\ngazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her\nlovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was\nfor ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could\nbestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in\nregarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one\nexpressive of disgust and affright.",
      "“Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? I only\nwonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in\nexclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the\nattempt to destroy them.\n\n“While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had\ncommitted the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I\nentered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman was\nsleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her\nwhose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the\nloveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose\njoy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. And then I bent over\nher and whispered, ‘Awake, fairest, thy lover is near—he who would\ngive his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my\nbeloved, awake!’",
      "“The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she\nindeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus\nwould she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.\nThe thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me—not I, but\nshe, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am for ever\nrobbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. The crime had\nits source in her; be hers the punishment! Thanks to the lessons of\nFelix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work\nmischief. I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of\nthe folds of her dress. She moved again, and I fled.\n\n“For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place,\nsometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and\nits miseries for ever. At length I wandered towards these mountains,\nand have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning\npassion which you alone can gratify. We may not part until you have\npromised to comply with my requisition. I am alone and miserable; man\nwill not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself\nwould not deny herself to me. My companion must be of the same species\nand have the same defects. This being you must create.”\n\nChapter 17",
      "The being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the\nexpectation of a reply. But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to\narrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his\nproposition. He continued,\n\n“You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the\ninterchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone\ncan do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to\nconcede.”\n\nThe latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had\ndied away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and\nas he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within\nme.\n\n“I do refuse it,” I replied; “and no torture shall ever extort a\nconsent from me. You may render me the most miserable of men, but you\nshall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another like\nyourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world. Begone! I\nhave answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.”",
      "“You are in the wrong,” replied the fiend; “and instead\nof threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious because I\nam miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator,\nwould tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I\nshould pity man more than he pities me? You would not call it murder if you\ncould precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the\nwork of your own hands. Shall I respect man when he condemns me? Let him\nlive with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would\nbestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance.\nBut that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our\nunion. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery. I will\nrevenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and\nchiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear\ninextinguishable hatred. Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor\nfinish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of\nyour birth.”\n\nA fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled\ninto contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently\nhe calmed himself and proceeded—",
      "“I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me, for you do\nnot reflect that _you_ are the cause of its excess. If any being felt\nemotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a\nhundredfold; for that one creature’s sake I would make peace with the\nwhole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised.\nWhat I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of\nanother sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it\nis all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be\nmonsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more\nattached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will be\nharmless and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! My creator, make me\nhappy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit! Let me see that I\nexcite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my\nrequest!”\n\nI was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences\nof my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument.\nHis tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature\nof fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion\nof happiness that it was in my power to bestow? He saw my change of\nfeeling and continued,",
      "“If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see\nus again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America. My food is not\nthat of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite;\nacorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will\nbe of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare.\nWe shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on\nman and will ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful\nand human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the\nwantonness of power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me,\nI now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment\nand persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.”\n\n“You propose,” replied I, “to fly from the habitations of\nman, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your\nonly companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man,\npersevere in this exile? You will return and again seek their kindness, and\nyou will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed,\nand you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction.\nThis may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.”",
      "“How inconstant are your feelings! But a moment ago you were moved by\nmy representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?\nI swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that\nwith the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man and\ndwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places. My evil passions\nwill have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy! My life will flow quietly\naway, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker.”\n\nHis words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him and\nsometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when\nI saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my\nfeelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle\nthese sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathise with him, I\nhad no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which\nwas yet in my power to bestow.\n\n“You swear,” I said, “to be harmless; but have you not\nalready shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust\nyou? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by\naffording a wider scope for your revenge?”",
      "“How is this? I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer. If\nI have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion;\nthe love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall\nbecome a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant. My vices\nare the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will\nnecessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel\nthe affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of\nexistence and events from which I am now excluded.”\n\nI paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various\narguments which he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues which\nhe had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight\nof all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had\nmanifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my\ncalculations; a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers\nand hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices\nwas a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a\nlong pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him and\nmy fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request.\nTurning to him, therefore, I said,",
      "“I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever,\nand every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall\ndeliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.”\n\n“I swear,” he cried, “by the sun, and by the blue sky of\nheaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my\nprayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again. Depart to your\nhome and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress with\nunutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall\nappear.”\n\nSaying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in\nmy sentiments. I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than\nthe flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the\nsea of ice.",
      "His tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of\nthe horizon when he departed. I knew that I ought to hasten my descent\ntowards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my\nheart was heavy, and my steps slow. The labour of winding among the\nlittle paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced\nperplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences\nof the day had produced. Night was far advanced when I came to the\nhalfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain. The stars\nshone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines\nrose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the\nground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange\nthoughts within me. I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I\nexclaimed, “Oh! stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock\nme; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as\nnought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.”\n\nThese were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to you\nhow the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I\nlistened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its\nway to consume me.",
      "Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no\nrest, but returned immediately to Geneva. Even in my own heart I could\ngive no expression to my sensations—they weighed on me with a\nmountain’s weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them.\nThus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the\nfamily. My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I\nanswered no question, scarcely did I speak. I felt as if I were placed\nunder a ban—as if I had no right to claim their sympathies—as if\nnever more might I enjoy companionship with them. Yet even thus I\nloved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate\nmyself to my most abhorred task. The prospect of such an occupation\nmade every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream,\nand that thought only had to me the reality of life.\n\nChapter 18",
      "Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and\nI could not collect the courage to recommence my work. I feared the\nvengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my\nrepugnance to the task which was enjoined me. I found that I could not\ncompose a female without again devoting several months to profound\nstudy and laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries\nhaving been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was\nmaterial to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my\nfather’s consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to\nevery pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an\nundertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to\nme. A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had\nhitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when\nunchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My\nfather saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts\ntowards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy,\nwhich every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring\nblackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took\nrefuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole days on the lake\nalone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the\nrippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh air and\nbright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and\non my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile\nand a more cheerful heart.",
      "It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father,\ncalling me aside, thus addressed me,\n\n“I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former\npleasures and seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still\nunhappy and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost in\nconjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me,\nand if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such a\npoint would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.”\n\nI trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued—\n\n“I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your\nmarriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the\nstay of my declining years. You were attached to each other from your\nearliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and\ntastes, entirely suited to one another. But so blind is the experience of\nman that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have\nentirely destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any\nwish that she might become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another\nwhom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to\nElizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear\nto feel.”",
      "“My dear father, reassure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and\nsincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my\nwarmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and prospects are\nentirely bound up in the expectation of our union.”\n\n“The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor,\ngives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced. If you\nfeel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast\na gloom over us. But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so\nstrong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate. Tell me,\ntherefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the\nmarriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us\nfrom that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You\nare younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent\nfortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future\nplans of honour and utility that you may have formed. Do not suppose,\nhowever, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on\nyour part would cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my words\nwith candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and\nsincerity.”",
      "I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable\nof offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of\nthoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas! To me\nthe idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and\ndismay. I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled\nand dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not\nimpend over me and my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival\nwith this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the\nground? I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with\nhis mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from\nwhich I expected peace.",
      "I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to\nEngland or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers\nof that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable\nuse to me in my present undertaking. The latter method of obtaining\nthe desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I\nhad an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my\nloathsome task in my father’s house while in habits of familiar\nintercourse with those I loved. I knew that a thousand fearful\naccidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to\nthrill all connected with me with horror. I was aware also that I\nshould often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the\nharrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my\nunearthly occupation. I must absent myself from all I loved while thus\nemployed. Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be\nrestored to my family in peace and happiness. My promise fulfilled,\nthe monster would depart for ever. Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some\naccident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my\nslavery for ever.",
      "These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to\nvisit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I\nclothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I\nurged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to\ncomply. After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that\nresembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find\nthat I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey,\nand he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my\nreturn, have restored me entirely to myself.\n\nThe duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or\nat most a year, was the period contemplated. One paternal kind\nprecaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion. Without\npreviously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth,\narranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh. This interfered\nwith the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the\ncommencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be\nan impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many\nhours of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry might stand between\nme and the intrusion of my foe. If I were alone, would he not at times\nforce his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to\ncontemplate its progress?",
      "To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union\nwith Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. My father’s\nage rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself, there was one\nreward I promised myself from my detested toils—one consolation for my\nunparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when,\nenfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and\nforget the past in my union with her.\n\nI now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me\nwhich filled me with fear and agitation. During my absence I should\nleave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and\nunprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my\ndeparture. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and\nwould he not accompany me to England? This imagination was dreadful in\nitself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.\nI was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of\nthis might happen. But through the whole period during which I was the\nslave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of\nthe moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend\nwould follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his\nmachinations.",
      "It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native\ncountry. My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth\ntherefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of\nmy suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief. It had\nbeen her care which provided me a companion in Clerval—and yet a man\nis blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman’s\nsedulous attention. She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand\nconflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent\nfarewell.\n\nI threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly\nknowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around.\nI remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on\nit, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with\nme. Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful\nand majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could\nonly think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy\nme whilst they endured.",
      "After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed\nmany leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for\nClerval. He came. Alas, how great was the contrast between us! He\nwas alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the\nsetting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new\nday. He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and\nthe appearances of the sky. “This is what it is to live,” he cried;\n“now I enjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are\nyou desponding and sorrowful!” In truth, I was occupied by gloomy\nthoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden\nsunrise reflected in the Rhine. And you, my friend, would be far more\namused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an\neye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections. I, a\nmiserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to\nenjoyment.",
      "We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to\nRotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London. During this\nvoyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.\nWe stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from\nStrasburgh, arrived at Mainz. The course of the Rhine below Mainz\nbecomes much more picturesque. The river descends rapidly and winds\nbetween hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw\nmany ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by\nblack woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed,\npresents a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you view\nrugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with\nthe dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory,\nflourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river\nand populous towns occupy the scene.",
      "We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers\nas we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits\ncontinually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the\nbottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to\ndrink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these\nwere my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had\nbeen transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by\nman. “I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenes\nof my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the\nsnowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black\nand impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance\nwere it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay\nappearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore\nup whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be\non the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain,\nwhere the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and\nwhere their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the\nnightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud;\nbut this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The\nmountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a\ncharm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.\nLook at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the\nisland, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now\nthat group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village\nhalf hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits\nand guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who\npile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of\nour own country.”",
      "Clerval! Beloved friend! Even now it delights me to record your words and\nto dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a\nbeing formed in the “very poetry of nature.” His wild and\nenthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His\nsoul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that\ndevoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only\nin the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to\nsatisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard\nonly with admiration, he loved with ardour:—\n\n——The sounding cataract\n    Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,\n    The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,\n    Their colours and their forms, were then to him\n    An appetite; a feeling, and a love,\n    That had no need of a remoter charm,\n    By thought supplied, or any interest\n    Unborrow’d from the eye.\n\n[Wordsworth’s “Tintern Abbey”.]",
      "And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost\nfor ever? Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful\nand magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the\nlife of its creator;—has this mind perished? Does it now only exist\nin my memory? No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and\nbeaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and\nconsoles your unhappy friend.\n\nPardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight\ntribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart,\noverflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. I will\nproceed with my tale.\n\nBeyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to\npost the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of\nthe river was too gentle to aid us.\n\nOur journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we\narrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.\nIt was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw\nthe white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene;\nthey were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the\nremembrance of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish\nArmada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich—places which I had heard\nof even in my country.",
      "At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul’s towering\nabove all, and the Tower famed in English history.\n\nChapter 19\n\nLondon was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several\nmonths in this wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the\nintercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this\ntime, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally\noccupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the\ncompletion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of\nintroduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most\ndistinguished natural philosophers.",
      "If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,\nit would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had\ncome over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of\nthe information they might give me on the subject in which my interest\nwas so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I\ncould fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of\nHenry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory\npeace. But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to\nmy heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my\nfellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and\nJustine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled\nmy soul with anguish.",
      "But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive\nand anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of\nmanners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of\ninstruction and amusement. He was also pursuing an object he had long\nhad in view. His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had\nin his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had\ntaken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of\nEuropean colonization and trade. In Britain only could he further the\nexecution of his plan. He was for ever busy, and the only check to his\nenjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. I tried to conceal this\nas much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures\nnatural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by\nany care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him,\nalleging another engagement, that I might remain alone. I now also\nbegan to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this\nwas to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling\non the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme\nanguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips\nto quiver, and my heart to palpitate.",
      "After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in\nScotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the\nbeauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient\nallurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth,\nwhere he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I,\nalthough I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and\nall the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.\n\nWe had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now\nFebruary. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the\nnorth at the expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not\nintend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford,\nMatlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of\nthis tour about the end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments and\nthe materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some\nobscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.\n\nWe quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at\nWindsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us\nmountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of\nstately deer were all novelties to us.",
      "From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our minds\nwere filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted\nthere more than a century and a half before. It was here that Charles\nI. had collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him,\nafter the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of\nParliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king and his\ncompanions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and\nson, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they\nmight be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a\ndwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these\nfeelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of\nthe city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.\nThe colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost\nmagnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows\nof exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,\nwhich reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and\ndomes, embosomed among aged trees.",
      "I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the\nmemory of the past and the anticipation of the future. I was formed\nfor peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent never\nvisited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what\nis beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in\nthe productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate\nelasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has\nentered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what\nI shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,\npitiable to others and intolerable to myself.",
      "We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs\nand endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most\nanimating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery\nwere often prolonged by the successive objects that presented\nthemselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the\nfield on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated\nfrom its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas\nof liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments\nand the remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains\nand look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten\ninto my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my\nmiserable self.",
      "We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next\nplace of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this village\nresembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but\neverything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of\ndistant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my\nnative country. We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets\nof natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same\nmanner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name\nmade me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit\nMatlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.",
      "From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in\nCumberland and Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the\nSwiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the\nnorthern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the\nrocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we\nmade some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into\nhappiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than\nmine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found\nin his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have\nimagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his\ninferiors. “I could pass my life here,” said he to me; “and among\nthese mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.”\n\nBut he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain\namidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and\nwhen he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit\nthat on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again\nengages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.",
      "We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland\nand conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period\nof our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them\nto travel on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my\npromise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dæmon’s\ndisappointment. He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance\non my relatives. This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment\nfrom which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited\nfor my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was\nmiserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I\nsaw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to\nread and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend\nfollowed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.\nWhen these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment,\nbut followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of\nhis destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the\nconsciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed\ndrawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.",
      "I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might\nhave interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well\nas Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.\nBut the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic\ncastle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur’s\nSeat, St. Bernard’s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for\nthe change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was\nimpatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.\n\nWe left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew’s, and\nalong the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.\nBut I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into\ntheir feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and\naccordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland\nalone. “Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself, and let this be our\nrendezvous. I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with\nmy motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short\ntime; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more\ncongenial to your own temper.”",
      "Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to\nremonstrate. He entreated me to write often. “I had rather be with\nyou,” he said, “in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch\npeople, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return,\nthat I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in\nyour absence.”\n\nHaving parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of\nScotland and finish my work in solitude. I did not doubt but that the\nmonster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have\nfinished, that he might receive his companion.\n\nWith this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of\nthe remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a place\nfitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were\ncontinually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely\naffording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its\ninhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs\ngave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they\nindulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from\nthe mainland, which was about five miles distant.",
      "On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of\nthese was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained but two\nrooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable\npenury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the\ndoor was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some\nfurniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have\noccasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been\nbenumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at\nand unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes\nwhich I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations\nof men.\n\nIn this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,\nwhen the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to\nlisten to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet. It was a\nmonotonous yet ever-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was\nfar different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills\nare covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the\nplains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when\ntroubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively\ninfant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.",
      "In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but\nas I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and\nirksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my\nlaboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night\nin order to complete my work. It was, indeed, a filthy process in\nwhich I was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind of\nenthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my\nmind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes\nwere shut to the horror of my proceedings. But now I went to it in\ncold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.\n\nThus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in\na solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from\nthe actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I\ngrew restless and nervous. Every moment I feared to meet my\npersecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing\nto raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much\ndreaded to behold. I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow\ncreatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.",
      "In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably\nadvanced. I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager\nhope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was\nintermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken\nin my bosom.\n\nChapter 20",
      "I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just\nrising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I\nremained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my\nlabour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention\nto it. As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to\nconsider the effects of what I was now doing. Three years before, I was\nengaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled\nbarbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest\nremorse. I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was\nalike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her\nmate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had\nsworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she\nhad not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and\nreasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her\ncreation. They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived\nloathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence\nfor it when it came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn\nwith disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him,\nand he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being\ndeserted by one of his own species.",
      "Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world,\nyet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon\nthirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon\nthe earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a\ncondition precarious and full of terror. Had I right, for my own benefit,\nto inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? I had before been moved\nby the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by\nhis fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my\npromise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me\nas their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at\nthe price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.\n\nI trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by\nthe light of the moon the dæmon at the casement. A ghastly grin\nwrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task\nwhich he had allotted to me. Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he\nhad loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide\nand desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the\nfulfilment of my promise.",
      "As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of\nmalice and treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my\npromise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion,\ntore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The wretch saw me\ndestroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for\nhappiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.\n\nI left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own\nheart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I\nsought my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate\nthe gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most\nterrible reveries.\n\nSeveral hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea;\nit was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature\nreposed under the eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alone\nspecked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound\nof voices as the fishermen called to one another. I felt the silence,\nalthough I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear\nwas suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a\nperson landed close to my house.",
      "In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one\nendeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a\npresentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who\ndwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation\nof helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain\nendeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.\n\nPresently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door\nopened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he\napproached me and said in a smothered voice,\n\n“You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you\nintend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and misery;\nI left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among\nits willow islands and over the summits of its hills. I have dwelt many\nmonths in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland. I have\nendured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my\nhopes?”\n\n“Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another like\nyourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.”",
      "“Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself\nunworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe\nyourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of\nday will be hateful to you. You are my creator, but I am your master;\nobey!”\n\n“The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is\narrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but\nthey confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in\nvice. Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a dæmon whose\ndelight is in death and wretchedness? Begone! I am firm, and your\nwords will only exasperate my rage.”",
      "The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the\nimpotence of anger. “Shall each man,” cried he, “find a\nwife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I had\nfeelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.\nMan! You may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and misery,\nand soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for\never. Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my\nwretchedness? You can blast my other passions, but revenge\nremains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die, but\nfirst you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your\nmisery. Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful. I will watch with\nthe wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall\nrepent of the injuries you inflict.”\n\n“Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.\nI have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend\nbeneath words. Leave me; I am inexorable.”\n\n“It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your\nwedding-night.”\n\nI started forward and exclaimed, “Villain! Before you sign my\ndeath-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.”",
      "I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with\nprecipitation. In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot\nacross the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the\nwaves.\n\nAll was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. I burned with rage to\npursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean. I\nwalked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination\nconjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I not\nfollowed him and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered him\nto depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland. I shuddered\nto think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.\nAnd then I thought again of his words—“_I will be with you on\nyour wedding-night._” That, then, was the period fixed for the\nfulfilment of my destiny. In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and\nextinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I\nthought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she\nshould find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I\nhad shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall\nbefore my enemy without a bitter struggle.",
      "The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became\ncalmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into\nthe depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last\nnight’s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I\nalmost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow\ncreatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. I\ndesired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true,\nbut uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to\nbe sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a\ndæmon whom I had myself created.\n\nI walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it\nloved and miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and the\nsun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep\nsleep. I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves\nwere agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. The sleep\ninto which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as\nif I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to\nreflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the\nwords of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared\nlike a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.",
      "The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my\nappetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a\nfishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;\nit contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to\njoin him. He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where\nhe was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired\nhis return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his\nIndian enterprise. He could not any longer delay his departure; but as\nhis journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now\nconjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of\nmy society on him as I could spare. He besought me, therefore, to\nleave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed\nsouthwards together. This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and\nI determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.",
      "Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered\nto reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I\nmust enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must\nhandle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The next\nmorning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door\nof my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had\ndestroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had\nmangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself and\nthen entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments\nout of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my\nwork to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly\nput them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them\nup, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the\nmeantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my\nchemical apparatus.",
      "Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place\nin my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon. I had\nbefore regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with\nwhatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film\nhad been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw\nclearly. The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur\nto me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not\nreflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in\nmy own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made\nwould be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I\nbanished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different\nconclusion.",
      "Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my\nbasket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.\nThe scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,\nbut I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a\ndreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my\nfellow creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was\nsuddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of\ndarkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound\nas it sank and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded, but\nthe air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then\nrising. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations\nthat I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a\ndirect position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the\nmoon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its\nkeel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I\nslept soundly.",
      "I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I\nfound that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and\nthe waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found\nthat the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from\nwhich I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found\nthat if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with\nwater. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I\nconfess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me\nand was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the\nworld that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the\nwide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in\nthe immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already\nbeen out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to\nmy other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds\nthat flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the\nsea; it was to be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your\ntask is already fulfilled!” I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and\nof Clerval—all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his\nsanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie so\ndespairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of\nclosing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.",
      "Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the\nhorizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became\nfree from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick\nand hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high\nland towards the south.\n\nAlmost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured\nfor several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of\nwarm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.\n\nHow mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have\nof life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a\npart of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a\nwild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived\nthe traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and found myself\nsuddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. I\ncarefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at\nlength saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of\nextreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place\nwhere I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with\nme. As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good\nharbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected\nescape.",
      "As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several\npeople crowded towards the spot. They seemed much surprised at my\nappearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered\ntogether with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me\na slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they\nspoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language. “My\ngood friends,” said I, “will you be so kind as to tell me the name of\nthis town and inform me where I am?”\n\n“You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice.\n“Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste,\nbut you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.”\n\nI was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a\nstranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and\nangry countenances of his companions. “Why do you answer me so\nroughly?” I replied. “Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to\nreceive strangers so inhospitably.”\n\n“I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the\nEnglish may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.”",
      "While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly\nincrease. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which\nannoyed and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn, but\nno one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the\ncrowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man\napproaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Come, sir, you must\nfollow me to Mr. Kirwin’s to give an account of yourself.”\n\n“Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not\nthis a free country?”\n\n“Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate,\nand you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was\nfound murdered here last night.”\n\nThis answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent;\nthat could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence\nand was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from\nfatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic\nto rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into\napprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that\nwas in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair\nall fear of ignominy or death.",
      "I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of\nthe frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my\nrecollection.\n\nChapter 21\n\nI was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old\nbenevolent man with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however,\nwith some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,\nhe asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.",
      "About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the\nmagistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with\nhis son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o’clock,\nthey observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in\nfor port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did\nnot land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about\ntwo miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,\nand his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding\nalong the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his\nlength on the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and by the\nlight of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,\nwho was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was the\ncorpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the\nwaves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even\nthat the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage\nof an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it\nto life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty\nyears of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of\nany violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.",
      "The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but\nwhen the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of\nmy brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a\nmist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for\nsupport. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew\nan unfavourable augury from my manner.\n\nThe son confirmed his father’s account, but when Daniel Nugent was\ncalled he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he\nsaw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;\nand as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same\nboat in which I had just landed.\n\nA woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door\nof her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour\nbefore she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with\nonly one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse\nwas afterwards found.\n\nAnother woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the\nbody into her house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed and\nrubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was\nquite gone.",
      "Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed\nthat, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it\nwas very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been\nobliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.\nBesides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body\nfrom another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know\nthe shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance\nof the town of —— from the place where I had deposited the corpse.\n\nMr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into\nthe room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what\neffect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably\nsuggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the\nmurder had been described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate\nand several other persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the\nstrange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but,\nknowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had\ninhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly\ntranquil as to the consequences of the affair.",
      "I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. How\ncan I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with\nhorror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and\nagony. The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses,\npassed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry\nClerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on\nthe body, I exclaimed, “Have my murderous machinations deprived you\nalso, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; other\nvictims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my\nbenefactor—”\n\nThe human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and\nI was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.\n\nA fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death; my\nravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the\nmurderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my\nattendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was\ntormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping\nmy neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke\nmy native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and\nbitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.",
      "Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not\nsink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming\nchildren, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and\nyouthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the\nnext a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I\nmade that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of\nthe wheel, continually renewed the torture?\n\nBut I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from\na dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by\ngaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.\nIt was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had\nforgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some\ngreat misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around\nand saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I\nwas, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.",
      "This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside\nme. She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her\ncountenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise\nthat class. The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of\npersons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her\ntone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English,\nand the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.\n\n“Are you better now, sir?” said she.\n\nI replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am;\nbut if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am\nstill alive to feel this misery and horror.”\n\n“For that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about the\ngentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you\nwere dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However, that’s none\nof my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty\nwith a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.”",
      "I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a\nspeech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt\nlanguid and unable to reflect on all that had passed. The whole series\nof my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it\nwere all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force\nof reality.\n\nAs the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew\nfeverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed\nme with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. The\nphysician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared\nthem for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the\nexpression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the\nsecond. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the\nhangman who would gain his fee?",
      "These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had\nshown me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room in the prison\nto be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who\nhad provided a physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to\nsee me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of\nevery human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and\nmiserable ravings of a murderer. He came, therefore, sometimes to see\nthat I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long\nintervals.\n\nOne day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes\nhalf open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloom\nand misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to\nremain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I\nconsidered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the\npenalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my\nthoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.\nHis countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to\nmine and addressed me in French,\n\n“I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to\nmake you more comfortable?”",
      "“I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole\nearth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.”\n\n“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to\none borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I\nhope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can\neasily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.”\n\n“That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become\nthe most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and\nhave been, can death be any evil to me?”\n\n“Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the\nstrange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some\nsurprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,\nseized immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was\npresented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so\nunaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across\nyour path.”\n\nAs Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on\nthis retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at\nthe knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose some\nastonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened\nto say,",
      "“Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on\nyour person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some\ntrace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune\nand illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one which I\ndiscovered from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote\nto Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.\nBut you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any\nkind.”\n\n“This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event;\ntell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am\nnow to lament?”\n\n“Your family is perfectly well,” said Mr. Kirwin with\ngentleness; “and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.”\n\nI know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it\ninstantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my\nmisery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for\nme to comply with his hellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes,\nand cried out in agony,\n\n“Oh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do not\nlet him enter!”\n\nMr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not help\nregarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in\nrather a severe tone,",
      "“I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father\nwould have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.”\n\n“My father!” cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed\nfrom anguish to pleasure. “Is my father indeed come? How kind, how\nvery kind! But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?”\n\nMy change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he\nthought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,\nand now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. He rose and\nquitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.\n\nNothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the\narrival of my father. I stretched out my hand to him and cried,\n\n“Are you then safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest?”\n\nMy father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by\ndwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my\ndesponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of\ncheerfulness. “What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!”\nsaid he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance\nof the room. “You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems\nto pursue you. And poor Clerval—”\n\nThe name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too\ngreat to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.",
      "“Alas! Yes, my father,” replied I; “some destiny of the\nmost horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I\nshould have died on the coffin of Henry.”\n\nWe were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the\nprecarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that\ncould ensure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my\nstrength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But the\nappearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I\ngradually recovered my health.\n\nAs my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black\nmelancholy that nothing could dissipate. The image of Clerval was\nfor ever before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation\ninto which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous\nrelapse. Alas! Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a\nlife? It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now\ndrawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these\nthrobbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears\nme to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also\nsink to rest. Then the appearance of death was distant, although the\nwish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours\nmotionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that\nmight bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.",
      "The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months\nin prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a\nrelapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country\ntown where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every\ncare of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence. I was spared\nthe disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not\nbrought before the court that decides on life and death. The grand\njury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney\nIslands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight\nafter my removal I was liberated from prison.",
      "My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a\ncriminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh\natmosphere and permitted to return to my native country. I did not\nparticipate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a\npalace were alike hateful. The cup of life was poisoned for ever, and\nalthough the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I\nsaw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by\nno light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. Sometimes\nthey were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark\norbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed\nthem; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I\nfirst saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.",
      "My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked\nof Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but\nthese words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a\nwish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved\ncousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more\nthe blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early\nchildhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a\nprison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and\nthese fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and\ndespair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the\nexistence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance\nto restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.",
      "Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally\ntriumphed over my selfish despair. It was necessary that I should\nreturn without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those\nI so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any\nchance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to\nblast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to\nthe existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with the\nmockery of a soul still more monstrous. My father still desired to\ndelay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a\njourney, for I was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being. My\nstrength was gone. I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day\npreyed upon my wasted frame.",
      "Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience,\nmy father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vessel\nbound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.\nIt was midnight. I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to\nthe dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my\nsight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should\nsoon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;\nyet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested\nshore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly\nthat I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest\ncompanion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I\nrepassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing\nwith my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for\nIngolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on\nto the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in\nwhich he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a\nthousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.",
      "Ever since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of taking\nevery night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug\nonly that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of\nlife. Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now\nswallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did\nnot afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a\nthousand objects that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind\nof nightmare; I felt the fiend’s grasp in my neck and could not free\nmyself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. My father, who was\nwatching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves\nwere around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of\nsecurity, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour\nand the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm\nforgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly\nsusceptible.\n\nChapter 22",
      "The voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I soon\nfound that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I\ncould continue my journey. My father’s care and attentions were\nindefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and\nsought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to\nseek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not\nabhorred! They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt\nattracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an\nangelic nature and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right\nto share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them whose\njoy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. How they\nwould, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know\nmy unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!\n\nMy father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by\nvarious arguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he thought that I\nfelt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of\nmurder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.",
      "“Alas! My father,” said I, “how little do you know me. \nHuman beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such\na wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent\nas I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause\nof this—I murdered her. William, Justine, and Henry—they all\ndied by my hands.”",
      "My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same\nassertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an\nexplanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of\ndelirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented\nitself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my\nconvalescence. I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence\nconcerning the wretch I had created. I had a persuasion that I should be\nsupposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue. But,\nbesides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my\nhearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of\nhis breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was\nsilent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret.\nYet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably\nfrom me. I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part\nrelieved the burden of my mysterious woe.\n\nUpon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder,\n“My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I entreat\nyou never to make such an assertion again.”",
      "“I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who\nhave viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the\nassassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.\nA thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have\nsaved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not\nsacrifice the whole human race.”\n\nThe conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were\nderanged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and\nendeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts. He wished as much as\npossible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in\nIreland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my\nmisfortunes.\n\nAs time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my\nheart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own\ncrimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them. By the utmost\nself-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which\nsometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners\nwere calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey\nto the sea of ice.\n\nA few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the\nfollowing letter from Elizabeth:\n\n“My dear Friend,",
      "“It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle\ndated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may\nhope to see you in less than a fortnight. My poor cousin, how much you\nmust have suffered! I expect to see you looking even more ill than\nwhen you quitted Geneva. This winter has been passed most miserably,\ntortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in\nyour countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of\ncomfort and tranquillity.\n\n“Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable\na year ago, even perhaps augmented by time. I would not disturb you at\nthis period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a\nconversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders\nsome explanation necessary before we meet.\n\nExplanation! You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain? If\nyou really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.\nBut you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet\nbe pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the\ncase, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I\nhave often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin.",
      "“You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of\nyour parents ever since our infancy. We were told this when young, and\ntaught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take\nplace. We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I\nbelieve, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older. But\nas brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each\nother without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our\ncase? Tell me, dearest Victor. Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual\nhappiness, with simple truth—Do you not love another?",
      "“You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at\nIngolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last\nautumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every\ncreature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our\nconnection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of\nyour parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations.\nBut this is false reasoning. I confess to you, my friend, that I love\nyou and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant\nfriend and companion. But it is your happiness I desire as well as my\nown when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally\nmiserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice. Even now\nI weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest\nmisfortunes, you may stifle, by the word _honour_, all hope of that\nlove and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. I, who\nhave so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries\ntenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes. Ah! Victor, be assured\nthat your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be\nmade miserable by this supposition. Be happy, my friend; and if you\nobey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth\nwill have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.",
      "“Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the\nnext day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain. My uncle\nwill send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your\nlips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I\nshall need no other happiness.\n\n“Elizabeth Lavenza.\n\n“Geneva, May 18th, 17—”\n\nThis letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of\nthe fiend—“_I will be with you on your\nwedding-night!_” Such was my sentence, and on that night would the\ndæmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of\nhappiness which promised partly to console my sufferings. On that night he\nhad determined to consummate his crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a\ndeadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were\nvictorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end. If he\nwere vanquished, I should be a free man. Alas! What freedom? Such as the\npeasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his\ncottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless,\npenniless, and alone, but free. Such would be my liberty except that in my\nElizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of\nremorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.",
      "Sweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and reread her letter, and some\nsoftened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal\ndreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the\nangel’s arm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to make\nher happy. If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet,\nagain, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. My\ndestruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer\nshould suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would\nsurely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. He had vowed\n_to be with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not consider that\nthreat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that\nhe was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately\nafter the enunciation of his threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my\nimmediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my\nfather’s happiness, my adversary’s designs against my life\nshould not retard it a single hour.",
      "In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and\naffectionate. “I fear, my beloved girl,” I said, “little happiness\nremains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in\nyou. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life\nand my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a\ndreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with\nhorror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only\nwonder that I survive what I have endured. I will confide this tale of\nmisery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place,\nfor, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us. But\nuntil then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it. This I most\nearnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.”\n\nIn about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth’s letter we returned\nto Geneva. The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were\nin her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a\nchange in her also. She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly\nvivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of\ncompassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I\nwas.",
      "The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure. Memory brought madness\nwith it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed\nme; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and\ndespondent. I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless,\nbewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.\n\nElizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice\nwould soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human\nfeelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with me and for me. When reason\nreturned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with\nresignation. Ah! It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the\nguilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is\notherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.\n\nSoon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with\nElizabeth. I remained silent.\n\n“Have you, then, some other attachment?”\n\n“None on earth. I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with\ndelight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate\nmyself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.”",
      "“My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befallen\nus, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love\nfor those whom we have lost to those who yet live. Our circle will be\nsmall but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.\nAnd when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of\ncare will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly\ndeprived.”\n\nSuch were the lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of the\nthreat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had\nyet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as\ninvincible, and that when he had pronounced the words “_I shall be with\nyou on your wedding-night_,” I should regard the threatened fate as\nunavoidable. But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were\nbalanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful\ncountenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the\nceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined,\nthe seal to my fate.",
      "Great God! If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish\nintention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself\nfor ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over\nthe earth than have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as if\npossessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real\nintentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I\nhastened that of a far dearer victim.\n\nAs the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or\na prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my\nfeelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the\ncountenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer\neye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union with placid contentment,\nnot unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed,\nthat what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate\ninto an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.",
      "Preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received,\nand all wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my own\nheart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness\ninto the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the\ndecorations of my tragedy. Through my father’s exertions a part of\nthe inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian\ngovernment. A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her. It\nwas agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa\nLavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake\nnear which it stood.\n\nIn the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the\nfiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger\nconstantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and\nby these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed, as the\nperiod approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be\nregarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for\nin my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed\nfor its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of\nas an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.",
      "Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to\ncalm her mind. But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my\ndestiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her;\nand perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had\npromised to reveal to her on the following day. My father was in the\nmeantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in\nthe melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.\n\nAfter the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my\nfather’s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our\njourney by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our\nvoyage on the following day. The day was fair, the wind favourable;\nall smiled on our nuptial embarkation.",
      "Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the\nfeeling of happiness. We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we\nwere sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the\nbeauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw\nMont Salêve, the pleasant banks of Montalègre, and at a distance,\nsurmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy\nmountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the\nopposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the\nambition that would quit its native country, and an almost\ninsurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.\n\nI took the hand of Elizabeth. “You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! If\nyou knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would\nendeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this\none day at least permits me to enjoy.”",
      "“Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth; “there is, I hope,\nnothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not\npainted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers to me\nnot to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I\nwill not listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move\nalong and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise\nabove the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more\ninteresting. Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in\nthe clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at\nthe bottom. What a divine day! How happy and serene all nature\nappears!”\n\nThus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all\nreflection upon melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating;\njoy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place\nto distraction and reverie.\n\nThe sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and\nobserved its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the\nlower hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached\nthe amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. The\nspire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range\nof mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.",
      "The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,\nsank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water\nand caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the\nshore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and\nhay. The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched\nthe shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp\nme and cling to me for ever.\n\nChapter 23\n\nIt was eight o’clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the\nshore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and\ncontemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured\nin darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.\n\nThe wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence\nin the west. The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was\nbeginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the\nflight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the\nscene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves\nthat were beginning to rise. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.",
      "I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the\nshapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious\nand watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in\nmy bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my\nlife dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that\nof my adversary was extinguished.\n\nElizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence,\nbut there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and\ntrembling, she asked, “What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?\nWhat is it you fear?”\n\n“Oh! Peace, peace, my love,” replied I; “this night, and\nall will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.”\n\nI passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how\nfearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife,\nand I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her\nuntil I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.",
      "She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages\nof the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to\nmy adversary. But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to\nconjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the\nexecution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful\nscream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired. As I\nheard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the\nmotion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood\ntrickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This\nstate lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed\ninto the room.\n\nGreat God! Why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the\ndestruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? She was\nthere, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down\nand her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere I\nturn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung\nby the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this and live? Alas!\nLife is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment\nonly did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.",
      "When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their\ncountenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others\nappeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I\nescaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my\nwife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the\nposture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon\nher arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have\nsupposed her asleep. I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but\nthe deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held\nin my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.\nThe murderous mark of the fiend’s grasp was on her neck, and the\nbreath had ceased to issue from her lips.",
      "While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.\nThe windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of\npanic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.\nThe shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be\ndescribed, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.\nA grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his\nfiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards\nthe window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me,\nleaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning,\nplunged into the lake.\n\nThe report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to\nthe spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with\nboats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we\nreturned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a\nform conjured up by my fancy. After having landed, they proceeded to\nsearch the country, parties going in different directions among the\nwoods and vines.",
      "I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the\nhouse, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken\nman, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my\neyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I\nwas carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had\nhappened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that\nI had lost.\n\nAfter an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room\nwhere the corpse of my beloved lay. There were women weeping around; I\nhung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no\ndistinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to\nvarious subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their\ncause. I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death\nof William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly\nof my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining\nfriends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now\nmight be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his\nfeet. This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action. I started\nup and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.",
      "There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the\nwind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was\nhardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men\nto row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from\nmental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt,\nand the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any\nexertion. I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way\nto every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were\nfamiliar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day\nbefore in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.\nTears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw\nthe fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had\nthen been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as\na great and sudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds might lower,\nbut nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had\nsnatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been\nso miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of\nman.",
      "But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last\noverwhelming event? Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their\n_acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know\nthat, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My\nown strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of\nmy hideous narration.\n\nI arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk\nunder the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old\nman! His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their\ndelight—his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with\nall that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having\nfew affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed\nbe the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste\nin wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated\naround him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to\nrise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.",
      "What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and\ndarkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes,\nindeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales\nwith the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a\ndungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear\nconception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my\nprison. For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I\nunderstood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.\n\nLiberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I\nawakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. As the\nmemory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their\ncause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable dæmon whom I had\nsent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a\nmaddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed\nthat I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal\nrevenge on his cursed head.",
      "Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to\nreflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about\na month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town\nand told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the\ndestroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole\nauthority for the apprehension of the murderer.\n\nThe magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. “Be\nassured, sir,” said he, “no pains or exertions on my part shall\nbe spared to discover the villain.”\n\n“I thank you,” replied I; “listen, therefore, to the\ndeposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange that I\nshould fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth\nwhich, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to\nbe mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.” My\nmanner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my\nown heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose\nquieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now related\nmy history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with\naccuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.",
      "The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued\nhe became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with\nhorror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted\non his countenance.\n\nWhen I had concluded my narration, I said, “This is the being whom I\naccuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your\nwhole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that\nyour feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those\nfunctions on this occasion.”\n\nThis address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own\nauditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given\nto a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon\nto act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity\nreturned. He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly afford you\nevery aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to\nhave powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an\nanimal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where\nno man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since\nthe commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he\nhas wandered or what region he may now inhabit.”",
      "“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if\nhe has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois\nand destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do not\ncredit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the\npunishment which is his desert.”\n\nAs I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.\n“You are mistaken,” said he. “I will exert myself, and if\nit is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer\npunishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have\nyourself described to be his properties, that this will prove\nimpracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should\nmake up your mind to disappointment.”\n\n“That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My\nrevenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I\nconfess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage\nis unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned\nloose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand; I have\nbut one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to\nhis destruction.”",
      "I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy\nin my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness\nwhich the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan\nmagistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of\ndevotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of\nmadness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and\nreverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.\n\n“Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of\nwisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say.”\n\nI broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on\nsome other mode of action.\n\nChapter 24\n\nMy present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was\nswallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone\nendowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and\nallowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise\ndelirium or death would have been my portion.\n\nMy first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I\nwas happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became\nhateful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels\nwhich had belonged to my mother, and departed.",
      "And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. I have\ntraversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships\nwhich travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. How I\nhave lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon\nthe sandy plain and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared\nnot die and leave my adversary in being.\n\nWhen I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I\nmight trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled,\nand I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain\nwhat path I should pursue. As night approached I found myself at the\nentrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father\nreposed. I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their\ngraves. Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which\nwere gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the\nscene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested\nobserver. The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to\ncast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the\nmourner.",
      "The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to\nrage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived,\nand to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass\nand kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By the\nsacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the\ndeep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the\nspirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery,\nuntil he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I will\npreserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun\nand tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my\neyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering\nministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed\nand hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now\ntorments me.”\n\nI had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me\nthat the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but\nthe furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.",
      "I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish\nlaugh. It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed\nit, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.\nSurely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have\ndestroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I\nwas reserved for vengeance. The laughter died away, when a well-known\nand abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an\naudible whisper, “I am satisfied, miserable wretch! You have\ndetermined to live, and I am satisfied.”\n\nI darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil\neluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone\nfull upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than\nmortal speed.\n\nI pursued him, and for many months this has been my task. Guided by a\nslight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly. The\nblue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend\nenter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I\ntook my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.",
      "Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I\nhave ever followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by\nthis horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself,\nwho feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die,\nleft some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my head, and I saw\nthe print of his huge step on the white plain. To you first entering\non life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand\nwhat I have felt and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue were the\nleast pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil\nand carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good\nfollowed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly\nextricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes,\nwhen nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast\nwas prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. The\nfare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but\nI will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had\ninvoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and\nI was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the\nfew drops that revived me, and vanish.",
      "I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the dæmon\ngenerally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the\ncountry chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldom\nseen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my\npath. I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers\nby distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed,\nwhich, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had\nprovided me with fire and utensils for cooking.",
      "My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during\nsleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most\nmiserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The\nspirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of\nhappiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of\nthis respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was\nsustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my\nfriends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent\ncountenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth’s\nvoice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by\na toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should\ncome and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest\nfriends. What agonising fondness did I feel for them! How did I cling to\ntheir dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and\npersuade myself that they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that\nburned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the\ndestruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the\nmechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the\nardent desire of my soul.",
      "What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he\nleft marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided\nme and instigated my fury. “My reign is not yet\nover”—these words were legible in one of these\ninscriptions—“you live, and my power is complete. Follow me; I\nseek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of\ncold and frost, to which I am impassive. You will find near this place, if\nyou follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed. Come on, my\nenemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable\nhours must you endure until that period shall arrive.”\n\nScoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee,\nmiserable fiend, to torture and death. Never will I give up my search\nuntil he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my\nElizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the\nreward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!",
      "As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the\ncold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The peasants were\nshut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to\nseize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to\nseek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be\nprocured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.\n\nThe triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One\ninscription that he left was in these words: “Prepare! Your toils\nonly begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter\nupon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting\nhatred.”",
      "My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I\nresolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support\nme, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts,\nuntil the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary\nof the horizon. Oh! How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the\nsouth! Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by\nits superior wildness and ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy when\nthey beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with\nrapture the boundary of their toils. I did not weep, but I knelt down\nand with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in\nsafety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary’s gibe,\nto meet and grapple with him.",
      "Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus\ntraversed the snows with inconceivable speed. I know not whether the\nfiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had\ndaily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that\nwhen I first saw the ocean he was but one day’s journey in advance, and\nI hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach. With new\ncourage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched\nhamlet on the seashore. I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the\nfiend and gained accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said,\nhad arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols,\nputting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of\nhis terrific appearance. He had carried off their store of winter\nfood, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a\nnumerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same\nnight, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his\njourney across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they\nconjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the\nice or frozen by the eternal frosts.",
      "On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.\nHe had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless\njourney across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few\nof the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a\ngenial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. Yet at the idea\nthat the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance\nreturned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.\nAfter a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered\nround and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.\n\nI exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of\nthe Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I\ndeparted from land.\n\nI cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured\nmisery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution\nburning within my heart could have enabled me to support. Immense and\nrugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard\nthe thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction. But\nagain the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.",
      "By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that\nI had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction\nof hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of\ndespondency and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured\nher prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery. Once, after\nthe poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the\nsummit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue,\ndied, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye\ncaught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to\ndiscover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I\ndistinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known\nform within. Oh! With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!\nWarm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might\nnot intercept the view I had of the dæmon; but still my sight was\ndimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that\noppressed me, I wept aloud.",
      "But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their\ndead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an\nhour’s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly\nirksome to me, I continued my route. The sledge was still visible, nor\ndid I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short\ntime some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. I indeed\nperceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days’ journey, I\nbeheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within\nme.\n\nBut now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were\nsuddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had\never done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as\nthe waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous\nand terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared;\nand, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a\ntremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished; in a few\nminutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left\ndrifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and\nthus preparing for me a hideous death.",
      "In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I\nmyself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your\nvessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.\nI had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded\nat the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and\nby these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in\nthe direction of your ship. I had determined, if you were going southwards,\nstill to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my\npurpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue\nmy enemy. But your direction was northwards. You took me on board when my\nvigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied\nhardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.",
      "Oh! When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the dæmon, allow\nme the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live? If I do,\nswear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him\nand satisfy my vengeance in his death. And do I dare to ask of you to\nundertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?\nNo; I am not so selfish. Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if\nthe ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he\nshall not live—swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated\nwoes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes. He is eloquent\nand persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but\ntrust him not. His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery\nand fiend-like malice. Hear him not; call on the names of William,\nJustine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and\nthrust your sword into his heart. I will hover near and direct the\nsteel aright.\n\nWalton, _in continuation._\n\nAugust 26th, 17—.",
      "You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not\nfeel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles\nmine? Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his\ntale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with\ndifficulty the words so replete with anguish. His fine and lovely eyes\nwere now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow\nand quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded his\ncountenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a\ntranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a\nvolcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression\nof the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.\n\nHis tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth,\nyet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me,\nand the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a\ngreater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations,\nhowever earnest and connected. Such a monster has, then, really existence!\nI cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I\nendeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his\ncreature’s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.",
      "“Are you mad, my friend?” said he. “Or whither does your\nsenseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the\nworld a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseries and do not seek\nto increase your own.”\n\nFrankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked\nto see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places,\nbut principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held\nwith his enemy. “Since you have preserved my narration,” said\nhe, “I would not that a mutilated one should go down to\nposterity.”",
      "Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest\ntale that ever imagination formed. My thoughts and every feeling of my\nsoul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale\nand his own elevated and gentle manners have created. I wish to soothe\nhim, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of\nevery hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! The only joy that he can\nnow know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and\ndeath. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and\ndelirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his\nfriends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or\nexcitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his\nfancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a\nremote world. This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render\nthem to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.",
      "Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and\nmisfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays\nunbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension. His\neloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates\na pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love,\nwithout tears. What a glorious creature must he have been in the days\nof his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin! He seems\nto feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.",
      "“When younger,” said he, “I believed myself destined for\nsome great enterprise. My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness\nof judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of\nthe worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed,\nfor I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that\nmight be useful to my fellow creatures. When I reflected on the work I had\ncompleted, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational\nanimal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But\nthis thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now\nserves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes\nare as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am\nchained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of\nanalysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I\nconceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot\nrecollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod\nheaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea\nof their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty\nambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once\nwas, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation. Despondency\nrarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell,\nnever, never again to rise.”",
      "Must I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have\nsought one who would sympathise with and love me. Behold, on these desert\nseas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his\nvalue and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.",
      "“I thank you, Walton,” he said, “for your kind intentions towards so\nmiserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh\naffections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any\nman be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth? Even\nwhere the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence,\nthe companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our\nminds which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our\ninfantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified,\nare never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more\ncertain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister or a\nbrother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early,\nsuspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend,\nhowever strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be\ncontemplated with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only\nthrough habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever\nI am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of\nClerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but one\nfeeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I\nwere engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive\nutility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. But\nsuch is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I\ngave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die.”",
      "My beloved Sister,\n\nSeptember 2d.\n\nI write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever\ndoomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit\nit. I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and\nthreaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave fellows whom I\nhave persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have\nnone to bestow. There is something terribly appalling in our\nsituation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me. Yet it is\nterrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered\nthrough me. If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.\n\nAnd what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of my\ndestruction, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, and\nyou will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! My\nbeloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is,\nin prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. But you have a husband\nand lovely children; you may be happy. Heaven bless you and make you so!",
      "My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion. He\nendeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession\nwhich he valued. He reminds me how often the same accidents have\nhappened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite\nof myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feel\nthe power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he\nrouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these\nvast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the\nresolutions of man. These feelings are transitory; each day of\nexpectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny\ncaused by this despair.\n\nSeptember 5th.\n\nA scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is\nhighly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot\nforbear recording it.\n\nWe are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger\nof being crushed in their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of\nmy unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of\ndesolation. Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire\nstill glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly\nroused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent\nlifelessness.",
      "I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny.\nThis morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his\neyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly—I was roused by half\na dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin. They\nentered, and their leader addressed me. He told me that he and his\ncompanions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation\nto me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse.\nWe were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they\nfeared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free\npassage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and\nlead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted\nthis. They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn\npromise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my\ncourse southwards.\n\nThis speech troubled me. I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived\nthe idea of returning if set free. Yet could I, in justice, or even in\npossibility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered, when\nFrankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly\nto have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled,\nand his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning towards the men,\nhe said,",
      "“What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you, then,\nso easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious\nexpedition? “And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was\nsmooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and\nterror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth\nand your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and\nthese you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for this\nwas it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the\nbenefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men\nwho encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. And now,\nbehold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first\nmighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content\nto be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and\nperil; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm\nfiresides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come\nthus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove\nyourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your\npurposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your\nhearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it\nshall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace\nmarked on your brows. Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and\nwho know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.”",
      "He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed\nin his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can\nyou wonder that these men were moved? They looked at one another and were\nunable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had\nbeen said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously\ndesired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage\nwould return.\n\nThey retired and I turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and\nalmost deprived of life.\n\nHow all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than\nreturn shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled. Yet I fear such will be my\nfate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never\nwillingly continue to endure their present hardships.\n\nSeptember 7th.\n\nThe die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed.\nThus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back\nignorant and disappointed. It requires more philosophy than I possess\nto bear this injustice with patience.\n\nSeptember 12th.\n\nIt is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of utility\nand glory; I have lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail these\nbitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted\ntowards England and towards you, I will not despond.",
      "September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard\nat a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction. We were\nin the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief\nattention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in\nsuch a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed. The ice cracked\nbehind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from\nthe west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly\nfree. When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native\ncountry was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them,\nloud and long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the\ncause of the tumult. “They shout,” I said, “because they\nwill soon return to England.”\n\n“Do you, then, really return?”\n\n“Alas! Yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead them\nunwillingly to danger, and I must return.”\n\n“Do so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up your purpose, but\nmine is assigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not. I am weak, but\nsurely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with\nsufficient strength.” Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the\nbed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.",
      "It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was\nentirely extinct. At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with\ndifficulty and was unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing\ndraught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the meantime he\ntold me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.",
      "His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient. I sat\nby his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but\npresently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near,\nsaid, “Alas! The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall\nsoon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think\nnot, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning\nhatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself\njustified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I\nhave been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable.\nIn a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was\nbound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and\nwell-being. This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to\nthat. My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to\nmy attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or\nmisery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to\ncreate a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity\nand selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction\nbeings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I\nknow where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he may\nrender no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was\nmine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I\nasked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now,\nwhen I am only induced by reason and virtue.",
      "“Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil\nthis task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have\nlittle chance of meeting with him. But the consideration of these\npoints, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I\nleave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near\napproach of death. I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I\nmay still be misled by passion.\n\n“That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in\nother respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the\nonly happy one which I have enjoyed for several years. The forms of\nthe beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms. Farewell,\nWalton! Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it\nbe only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in\nscience and discoveries. Yet why do I say this? I have myself been\nblasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.”\n\nHis voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his\neffort, he sank into silence. About half an hour afterwards he\nattempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and\nhis eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed\naway from his lips.",
      "Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this\nglorious spirit? What can I say that will enable you to understand the\ndepth of my sorrow? All that I should express would be inadequate and\nfeeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of\ndisappointment. But I journey towards England, and I may there find\nconsolation.\n\nI am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the\nbreeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again there\nis a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin\nwhere the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise and examine.\nGood night, my sister.\n\nGreat God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the\nremembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail\nit; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this\nfinal and wonderful catastrophe.",
      "I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable\nfriend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to\ndescribe—gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its\nproportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long\nlocks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and\napparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my\napproach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung\ntowards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of\nsuch loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily and\nendeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.\nI called on him to stay.\n\nHe paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the\nlifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and\nevery feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some\nuncontrollable passion.\n\n“That is also my victim!” he exclaimed. “In his murder my\ncrimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its\nclose! Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does it\navail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee\nby destroying all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, he cannot answer\nme.”",
      "His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to\nme the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his\nenemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I\napproached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his\nface, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I\nattempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster\ncontinued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I\ngathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.\n\n“Your repentance,” I said, “is now superfluous. If you\nhad listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse\nbefore you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity,\nFrankenstein would yet have lived.”",
      "“And do you dream?” said the dæmon. “Do you think that I was then\ndead to agony and remorse? He,” he continued, pointing to the corpse,\n“he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. Oh! Not the\nten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the\nlingering detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me\non, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. Think you that the\ngroans of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart was fashioned to be\nsusceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice\nand hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without\ntorture such as you cannot even imagine.",
      "“After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken\nand overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I\nabhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of\nmy existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for\nhappiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me\nhe sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the\nindulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter\nindignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I\nrecollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished. I\nknew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the\nslave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not\ndisobey. Yet when she died! Nay, then I was not miserable. I had\ncast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my\ndespair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had no\nchoice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly\nchosen. The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable\npassion. And now it is ended; there is my last victim!”",
      "I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called\nto mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and\npersuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my\nfriend, indignation was rekindled within me. “Wretch!” I said.\n“It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you\nhave made. You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are\nconsumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend!\nIf he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would\nhe become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you\nfeel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn\nfrom your power.”",
      "“Oh, it is not thus—not thus,” interrupted the being.\n“Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to\nbe the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.\nNo sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of\nvirtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being\noverflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has\nbecome to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into\nbitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am\ncontent to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am\nwell satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once\nmy fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once\nI falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would\nlove me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was\nnourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has\ndegraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no\nmalignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the\nfrightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same\ncreature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent\nvisions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the\nfallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man\nhad friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.",
      "“You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my\ncrimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them\nhe could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured\nwasting in impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did\nnot satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still\nI desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no\ninjustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all\nhumankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his\nfriend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic\nwho sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous\nand immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an\nabortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my\nblood boils at the recollection of this injustice.",
      "“But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and\nthe helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to\ndeath his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have\ndevoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and\nadmiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that\nirremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but\nyour abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the\nhands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the\nimagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands\nwill meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.",
      "“Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work\nis nearly complete. Neither yours nor any man’s death is needed to\nconsummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done,\nbut it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this\nsacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me\nthither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall\ncollect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its\nremains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would\ncreate such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the\nagonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet\nunquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no\nmore, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no\nlonger see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. Light,\nfeeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my\nhappiness. Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first\nopened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the\nrustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to\nme, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by\ncrimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in\ndeath?",
      "“Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these\neyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive\nand yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better\nsatiated in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou\ndidst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness;\nand if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think\nand feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than\nthat which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to\nthine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my\nwounds until death shall close them for ever.\n\n“But soon,” he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, “I\nshall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these burning\nmiseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and\nexult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration\nwill fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit\nwill sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus.\nFarewell.”\n\nHe sprang from the cabin-window as he said this, upon the ice raft\nwhich lay close to the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves and\nlost in darkness and distance."
